0,TONY STARK,Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…,MALE
1,CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?",FEMALE
2,TONY STARK,Yes,MALE
3,CHRISTINE EVERHART,And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…,FEMALE
4,TONY STARK,"I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.",MALE
5,TONY STARK,"I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.",MALE
6,ANTON VANKO,Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.,MALE
7,IVAN VANKO,Don’t listen to that crap,MALE
8,ANTON VANKO,I’m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.,MALE
9,MAN,270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone,MALE
10,PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THE CROWD,Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!,NEUTRAL
11,TONY STARK,It’s good to be back. You missed me?,MALE
12,MAN IN CROWD,Blow something up!,MALE
13,TONY STARK,"I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.",MALE
14,WOMAN IN CROWD,I love you Tony!,FEMALE
15,TONY STARK,"Please, it’s not about me.  It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.  And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.",MALE
16,HOWARD STARK,"Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,  and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.",MALE
17,REPORTER,"We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.",MALE
18,HAPPY HOGAN,Make sure you join me…,MALE
19,TONY STARK,"All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.",MALE
20,HAPPY HOGAN,"Open up, let’s go.",MALE
21,TONY STARK,"Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.",MALE
22,PEOPLE,"TONY STARK, Tony",NEUTRAL
23,TONY STARK,"Hey, hey.",MALE
24,WOMAN,Call me.,FEMALE
25,HAPPY HOGAN,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",MALE
26,TONY STARK,Hello. It would be a pleasure.,MALE
27,HAPPY HOGAN,Okay,MALE
28,TONY STARK,See you buddy,MALE
29,HAPPY HOGAN,This is Larry.,MALE
30,TONY STARK,"Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.",MALE
31,LARRY,Call me. Call me.,FEMALE
32,HAPPY HOGAN,Larry King.,MALE
33,TONY STARK,"Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.",MALE
34,HAPPY HOGAN,"Come on, Tony. There we go.",MALE
35,TONY STARK,Very mellow.,MALE
36,HAPPY HOGAN,That wasn’t so bad.,MALE
37,TONY STARK,"No, it was perfect.",MALE
38,HAPPY HOGAN,"Look what we got here, the new model.",MALE
39,TONY STARK,"Hey, does she come with the car?",MALE
40,HAPPY HOGAN,I certainly hope so. Hi.,MALE
41,TONY STARK,Hi. And you are?,MALE
42,WOMAN,Marshal.,FEMALE
43,TONY STARK,Irish. I like it.,MALE
44,MARSHAL,Pleased to meet you Tony.,FEMALE
45,TONY STARK,I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?,MALE
46,MARSHAL,Bedford.,FEMALE
47,TONY STARK,What are you doing here?,MALE
48,MARSHAL,Looking for you.,FEMALE
49,TONY STARK,Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?,MALE
50,MARSHAL,Serving subpoenas.,FEMALE
51,TONY STARK,Yikes.,MALE
52,HAPPY HOGAN,He doesn’t like to be handed things.,MALE
53,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I have a peeve.",MALE
54,MARSHAL,I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.,FEMALE
55,TONY STARK,Can I see a badge?,MALE
56,MARSHAL,You wanna see the badge?,FEMALE
57,HAPPY HOGAN,He likes the badge.,MALE
58,MARSHAL,You still like it?,FEMALE
59,TONY STARK,Yep.  How far are we from D.C.?,MALE
60,HAPPY HOGAN,D.C.? 250 miles.,MALE
61,STERN,"Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.",MALE
62,TONY STARK,Yes dear?,MALE
63,STERN,Can I have your attention?,MALE
64,TONY STARK,Absolutely.,MALE
65,STERN,Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?,MALE
66,TONY STARK,I do not.,MALE
67,STERN,You do not?,MALE
68,TONY STARK,"I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.",MALE
69,STERN,The Iron Man weapon.,MALE
70,TONY STARK,My device does not fit that description.,MALE
71,STERN,Well… How would you describe it?,MALE
72,TONY STARK,"I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.",MALE
73,STERN,As?,MALE
74,TONY STARK,It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.,MALE
75,STERN,"It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.",MALE
76,TONY STARK,"Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…",MALE
77,STERN,My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.,MALE
78,TONY STARK,"Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.",MALE
79,STERN,"Look, I’m no expert…",MALE
80,TONY STARK,In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.,MALE
81,STERN,"I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.",MALE
82,TONY STARK,"Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.",MALE
83,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.",MALE
84,STERN,That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.,MALE
85,TONY STARK,Rhodey? What?,MALE
86,TONY STARK,"Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.",MALE
87,JAMES RHODES,"Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.",MALE
88,TONY STARK,I just…,MALE
89,JAMES RHODES,Drop it.,MALE
90,TONY STARK,"All right, I’ll drop it.",MALE
91,STERN,"I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?",MALE
92,JAMES RHODES,"You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?",MALE
93,STERN,"Yes, sir.",MALE
94,JAMES RHODES,It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.,MALE
95,STERN,I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…,MALE
96,JAMES RHODES,You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…,MALE
97,STERN,"Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.",MALE
98,JAMES RHODES,"Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…",MALE
99,STERN,That’s enough Colonel,MALE
100,JAMES RHODES,…to fold Mr Stark…,MALE
101,STERN,That’s enough,MALE
102,JAMES RHODES,"…into the existing chain of command, Senator.",MALE
103,TONY STARK,"I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.",MALE
104,TONY STARK,We can amend the hours a little bit.,MALE
105,STERN,"I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.",MALE
106,JAMES RHODES,I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.,MALE
107,STERN,"With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.",MALE
108,JAMES RHODES,"Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…",MALE
109,JAMES RHODES,"… indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.",MALE
110,TONY STARK,"Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.",MALE
111,STERN,What is he doing?,MALE
112,TONY STARK,"If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea.",MALE
113,STERN,Can you turn that off? Take it off.,MALE
114,TONY STARK,Iran.,MALE
115,TONY STARK,No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?,MALE
116,TONY STARK,"JUSTIN HAMMER, you’re on TV. Focus up.",MALE
117,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.",MALE
118,TONY STARK,"Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.",MALE
119,JUSTIN HAMMER,I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.,MALE
120,STERN,I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…,MALE
121,TONY STARK,"The point is, you’re welcome, I guess",MALE
122,STERN,For what?,MALE
123,TONY STARK,Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.,MALE
124,TONY STARK,I’ve successfully privatised world peace.,MALE
125,TONY STARK,What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.,MALE
126,STERN,"you, Mr Stark.  you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.",MALE
127,TONY STARK,Okay.,MALE
128,STERN,You’ve been a delight.,MALE
129,TONY STARK,My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.,MALE
130,TONY STARK,"Wake up, Daddy’s home.",MALE
131,JARVIS,"Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.",MALE
132,TONY STARK,You!,MALE
133,TONY STARK,I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.,MALE
134,TONY STARK,How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?,MALE
135,JARVIS,"We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.",MALE
136,TONY STARK,Check palladium levels.,MALE
137,JARVIS,"Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.",MALE
138,TONY STARK,"God, they’re running out quick.",MALE
139,JARVIS,"I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.",MALE
140,JARVIS,"You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.",MALE
141,JARVIS,Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…,MALE
142,TONY STARK,Mute.,MALE
143,PEPPER POTTS,Is this a joke? What are you thinking?,FEMALE
144,TONY STARK,What?,MALE
145,PEPPER POTTS,What are you thinking?,FEMALE
146,TONY STARK,"Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.",MALE
147,PEPPER POTTS,Did you just donate…,FEMALE
148,TONY STARK,Keep your business.,MALE
149,PEPPER POTTS,…our entire modern art collection to the…,FEMALE
150,TONY STARK,Boy Scouts of America.,MALE
151,PEPPER POTTS,…Boy Scouts of America?,FEMALE
152,TONY STARK,"Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.",MALE
153,PEPPER POTTS,"No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.",FEMALE
154,TONY STARK,It was a tax write-off. I needed that.,MALE
155,PEPPER POTTS,"You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.",FEMALE
156,TONY STARK,"Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.",MALE
157,PEPPER POTTS,The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.,FEMALE
158,TONY STARK,I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?,MALE
159,PEPPER POTTS,That’s rude.,FEMALE
160,TONY STARK,There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…,MALE
161,PEPPER POTTS,The Expo is your ego gone crazy.,FEMALE
162,TONY STARK,Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.,MALE
163,PEPPER POTTS,You’ve got to be kidding.,FEMALE
164,TONY STARK,I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.,MALE
165,PEPPER POTTS,Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?,FEMALE
166,TONY STARK,No. Our stocks have never been higher.,MALE
167,PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, from a managerial standpoint.",FEMALE
168,TONY STARK,"You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.",MALE
169,PEPPER POTTS,Let me give you an example.,FEMALE
170,TONY STARK,Let’s move onto another subject.,MALE
171,PEPPER POTTS,"No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.",FEMALE
172,TONY STARK,I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.,MALE
173,TONY STARK,Let’s see what I can get going on here.,MALE
174,PEPPER POTTS,"Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.",FEMALE
175,TONY STARK,Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.,MALE
176,PEPPER POTTS,"And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…",FEMALE
177,TONY STARK,Everything was my idea.,MALE
178,PEPPER POTTS,…and you won’t make a decision.,FEMALE
179,TONY STARK,I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert.  You do it.,MALE
180,PEPPER POTTS,I do what?,FEMALE
181,TONY STARK,Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.,MALE
182,PEPPER POTTS,"Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.",FEMALE
183,TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.",MALE
184,PEPPER POTTS,You will not give me the information…,FEMALE
185,TONY STARK,I’m not asking you to try…,MALE
186,PEPPER POTTS,…in order to…,FEMALE
187,TONY STARK,I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.,MALE
188,PEPPER POTTS,I am trying to do it.,FEMALE
189,TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, you’re not listening to me!",MALE
190,PEPPER POTTS,"No, you are not listening to me.",FEMALE
191,TONY STARK,I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?,MALE
192,PEPPER POTTS,Have you been drinking?,FEMALE
193,TONY STARK,"Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.  Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. . I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you.  Congratulations? Take it, just take it.",MALE
194,PEPPER POTTS,I don’t know what to think.,FEMALE
195,TONY STARK,"Don’t think, drink. There you go.",MALE
196,PEPPER POTTS,The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?,FEMALE
197,TONY STARK,I’m on happy time.  Sorry.,MALE
198,HAPPY HOGAN,What the hell was that?,MALE
199,TONY STARK,It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.,MALE
200,HAPPY HOGAN,"It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it",MALE
201,TONY STARK,"All right, put them up. Come on.",MALE
202,PEPPER POTTS,I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.,FEMALE
203,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I need you to initial each box.,FEMALE
204,HAPPY HOGAN,Lesson one. Never take your eye off…,MALE
205,TONY STARK,"That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?",MALE
206,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Rushman. Natalie Rushman,FEMALE
207,TONY STARK,Front and centre. Come into the church.,MALE
208,PEPPER POTTS,No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…,FEMALE

213,HAPPY HOGAN,No problem.,MALE
214,TONY STARK,Pepper.,MALE
215,PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
216,TONY STARK,Who is she?,MALE
217,PEPPER POTTS,She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.,FEMALE
218,TONY STARK,"I need a new assistant, boss.",MALE
219,PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.",FEMALE

227,PEPPER POTTS,"What, are you gonna google her now?",FEMALE
228,TONY STARK,"I thought I was ogling her.  Wow. Very, very impressive individual.",MALE
229,PEPPER POTTS,"You’re so predictable, you know that?",FEMALE
230,TONY STARK,"She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?",MALE
231,PEPPER POTTS,No one speaks Latin.,FEMALE
232,TONY STARK,No one speaks Latin,MALE
233,PEPPER POTTS,"It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.",FEMALE
234,TONY STARK,Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.,MALE
235,PEPPER POTTS,Well…,FEMALE
236,TONY STARK,I need her. She’s got everything that I need.,MALE

398,POLICE OFFICER,"We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.",MALE
399,TONY STARK,Where are we going?,MALE
400,POLICE OFFICER,Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.,MALE
401,TONY STARK,Five minutes.,MALE
402,POLICE OFFICER,Five minutes.,MALE
403,TONY STARK,"Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.",MALE
404,IVAN VANKO,"You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.",MALE
405,TONY STARK,"Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?",MALE
406,IVAN VANKO,My father. Anton Vanko.,MALE
407,TONY STARK,"Well, I never heard of him.",MALE
408,IVAN VANKO,My father is the reason you’re alive.,MALE
409,TONY STARK,"The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.",MALE
410,IVAN VANKO,"Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.",MALE
411,TONY STARK,Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap.,MALE
412,IVAN VANKO,"Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die.",MALE
413,STERN,"It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”",MALE
414,TONY STARK,Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.,MALE
415,PEPPER POTTS,What is that?,FEMALE
416,TONY STARK,This is your in-flight meal.,MALE
417,PEPPER POTTS,Did you just make that?,FEMALE
418,TONY STARK,Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?,MALE
419,PEPPER POTTS,"TONY STARK, what are you not telling me?",FEMALE

421,PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, yes.",FEMALE
422,TONY STARK,It’s a great place to be healthy.,MALE
423,PEPPER POTTS,I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.,FEMALE
424,TONY STARK,"Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…",MALE
425,PEPPER POTTS,"Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.",FEMALE
426,TONY STARK,"As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.",MALE
427,PEPPER POTTS,A leave?,FEMALE
428,TONY STARK,A company retreat.,MALE
429,PEPPER POTTS,A retreat? During a time like this?,FEMALE
430,TONY STARK,"Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.",MALE
431,PEPPER POTTS,Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.,FEMALE
432,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?",MALE
433,JACK,We have some salmon carpaccio.,MALE
434,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.",MALE
435,JUSTIN HAMMER,Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?,MALE
436,IVAN VANKO,"Very good, man.",MALE

447,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?",MALE
448,PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.",FEMALE
449,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yes, of course.  The AP wants a quote.",FEMALE
450,PEPPER POTTS,Don’t tell them. Fax them…,FEMALE
451,JAMES RHODES,Where is he?,MALE
452,NATASHA ROMANOFF,He doesn’t want to be disturbed.,FEMALE
453,PEPPER POTTS,He’s downstairs.,FEMALE
454,NEWS READER,But what happened in Monaco?,MALE
455,PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, but….",FEMALE
456,NEWS READER,"But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”",MALE

459,JAMES RHODES,"TONY STARK, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, TONY STARK, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?",MALE
460,TONY STARK,Let’s go.,MALE
461,JAMES RHODES,"Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?",MALE
462,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I should get to my desk.  See that cigar box?",MALE
463,JAMES RHODES,Yeah.,MALE
464,TONY STARK,It’s palladium.,MALE
465,JAMES RHODES,Is that supposed to be smoking?,MALE
466,TONY STARK,"If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.",MALE
467,JAMES RHODES,You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?,MALE
468,TONY STARK,Road rash. Thank you.  What are you looking at?,MALE
469,JAMES RHODES,I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.,MALE
470,TONY STARK,"You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.",MALE
471,JUSTIN HAMMER,"This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around.  You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.",MALE

That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait!  Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.",MALE
476,IVAN VANKO,What you want them do?,MALE
477,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?",MALE
478,IVAN VANKO,I can do that. No problem.,MALE

589,JUSTIN HAMMER,"IVAN VANKO, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.",MALE
590,IVAN VANKO,"Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.",MALE
591,JUSTIN HAMMER,"These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.",MALE
592,GENERAL,Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?,MALE
593,JAMES RHODES,Fully mission-capable.,MALE
594,GENERAL,Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.,MALE
595,JAMES RHODES,Sir?,MALE
596,GENERAL,Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.,MALE
597,JAMES RHODES,"Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…",MALE
598,GENERAL,"Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.",MALE
599,JAMES RHODES,"Yes, General, but…",MALE
600,GENERAL,It’s also an order.,MALE
601,JAMES RHODES,Yes sir.,MALE
602,GENERAL,"Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.",MALE
603,JAMES RHODES,Thank you sir.,MALE
604,NICK FURY,That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.,MALE
605,TONY STARK,"No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…",MALE
606,NICK FURY,"No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.",MALE
607,TONY STARK,"Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?",MALE
608,NICK FURY,"Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.",MALE
609,TONY STARK,You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?,MALE
610,NICK FURY,He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.,MALE
611,TONY STARK,He said that?,MALE
612,NICK FURY,"Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.",MALE
613,TONY STARK,"I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.",MALE
614,NICK FURY,What do you remember about your dad?,MALE
615,TONY STARK,"He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.",MALE
616,NICK FURY,That’s not true.,MALE
617,TONY STARK,"Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.",MALE
618,NICK FURY,"As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.",MALE
619,TONY STARK,What?,MALE
620,NICK FURY,I got a two o’clock,MALE
621,TONY STARK,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?",MALE
622,NICK FURY,"Okay, you’re good, right?",MALE
623,TONY STARK,"No, I’m not good.",MALE
624,NICK FURY,You got this? Right? Right?,MALE
625,TONY STARK,Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.,MALE
626,NICK FURY,"Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember PHIL COULSON, right?",MALE
627,TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
628,NICK FURY,"And TONY STARK, remember, I got my eye on you.",MALE
629,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck.,FEMALE
630,TONY STARK,"Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.",MALE
631,PHIL COULSON,"I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?",MALE
632,TONY STARK,"I think I got it, yeah.",MALE
633,PHIL COULSON,Enjoy your evening’s entertainment.,MALE
634,MAJOR ALLEN,Think this is the power source?,MALE
635,JAMES RHODES,"Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?",MALE
636,MAJOR ALLEN,"Yes, sir.",MALE
637,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?",MALE
638,JAMES RHODES,"Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.",MALE
639,JUSTIN HAMMER,"What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…",MALE
640,JAMES RHODES,That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.,MALE
641,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, you’re talking to the right guy.  Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.",MALE
642,JAMES RHODES,I think I’ll take it.,MALE
643,JUSTIN HAMMER,Which one?,MALE
644,JAMES RHODES,All of it.,MALE
645,JUSTIN HAMMER,All of it.,MALE
646,HOWARD STARK,"Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath,  and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.

City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… TONY STARK, what are you doing back there? What is that?  Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go.",MALE

649,MAN,Are you waiting on me?,MALE
650,HOWARD STARK,"So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything  is achievable through technology.  Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you.",MALE
651,TONY STARK,How much?,MALE
652,STRAWBERRY MAN,$6. Six.,MALE

724,JARVIS,"What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?",MALE
725,TONY STARK,"I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.  Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad.  Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.",MALE
726,JARVIS,The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.,MALE

760,JUSTIN HAMMER,This is not what I wanted.,MALE
761,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.",MALE
762,IVAN VANKO,Hey!,MALE
763,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?",MALE

765,JUSTIN HAMMER,"I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV.",MALE

790,ANNOUNCER,…Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.,FEMALE
791,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.",MALE
792,PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, Lord.",FEMALE
793,JUSTIN HAMMER,"Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink.  Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone.  Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war  Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.",MALE

997,JAMES RHODES,It wasn’t a question.,MALE
998,TONY STARK,How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?,MALE
999,NICK FURY,"I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.",MALE
1000,TONY STARK,"“Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.",MALE
1001,NICK FURY,Read on.,MALE
1002,TONY STARK,“Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.,MALE
1003,NICK FURY,Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant.,MALE
1004,TONY STARK,"You can’t afford me.  Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.",MALE
1005,NICK FURY,I’ll see what I can do.,MALE
1006,STERN,"It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure.  Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.",MALE
1007,JAMES RHODES,Thank you sir.,MALE
1008,STERN,"Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.  Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.",MALE
1009,PHIL COULSON,"Sir, we’ve found it.",MALE
