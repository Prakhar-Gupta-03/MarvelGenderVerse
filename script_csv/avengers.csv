434,434,434,434,434,NICK FURY,"How desperate am I?... You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. ",MALE
435,435,435,435,435,LOKI,"Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? A... warm light for all mankind to share? And then to be reminded what real power is.",MALE

439,439,439,439,439,THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. ",MALE
440,440,440,440,440,STEVE ROGERS,"An army, from outer space? ",MALE
441,441,441,441,441,BRUCE BANNER,"So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. ",MALE
442,442,442,442,442,THOR,Selvig?,MALE
443,443,443,443,443,BRUCE BANNER,He’s an astrophysicist.,MALE

447,447,447,447,447,BRUCE BANNER,"I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. ",MALE

452,452,452,452,452,TONY STARK,"It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing.",MALE
453,453,453,453,453,TONY STARK,"Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? ",MALE
454,454,454,454,454,MARIA HILL,He turns!,FEMALE
455,455,455,455,455,TONY STARK,"Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. ",MALE
456,456,456,456,456,MARIA HILL,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?,FEMALE
457,457,457,457,457,TONY STARK,"Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? ",MALE
458,458,458,458,458,STEVE ROGERS,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,MALE
459,459,459,459,459,BRUCE BANNER,He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,MALE
460,460,460,460,460,TONY STARK,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. ",MALE
461,461,461,461,461,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. ",MALE

463,463,463,463,463,STEVE ROGERS,Is that what just happened?,MALE
464,464,464,464,464,TONY STARK,"It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. ",MALE
465,465,465,465,465,BRUCE BANNER,...Thanks.,MALE
466,466,466,466,466,NICK FURY,Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.,MALE
467,467,467,467,467,STEVE ROGERS,I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.,MALE
468,468,468,468,468,NICK FURY,"I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. ",MALE
469,469,469,469,469,THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand-,MALE
470,470,470,470,470,STEVE ROGERS,I do!,MALE
471,471,471,471,471,STEVE ROGERS,I...I understood that reference.,MALE
472,472,472,472,472,TONY STARK,"Shall we play, Doctor? ",MALE
473,473,473,473,473,BRUCE BANNER,"This way, sir.",MALE
474,474,474,474,474,BRUCE BANNER,The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.,MALE
475,475,475,475,475,TONY STARK,If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.,MALE
476,476,476,476,476,BRUCE BANNER,All I packed was a toothbrush.,MALE
477,477,477,477,477,TONY STARK,"You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. ",MALE

484,484,484,484,484,TONY STARK,"Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? ",MALE
485,485,485,485,485,STEVE ROGERS,Is everything a joke to you?,MALE
486,486,486,486,486,TONY STARK,Funny things are.,MALE
487,487,487,487,487,STEVE ROGERS,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. ",MALE
488,488,488,488,488,BRUCE BANNER,No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.,MALE
489,489,489,489,489,TONY STARK,"You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. ",MALE
490,490,490,490,490,STEVE ROGERS,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. ",MALE
491,491,491,491,491,TONY STARK,"You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. ",MALE
492,492,492,492,492,STEVE ROGERS,You think Fury’s hiding something?,MALE
493,493,493,493,493,TONY STARK,"He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? ",MALE
494,494,494,494,494,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- ",MALE

497,497,497,497,497,STEVE ROGERS,I heard it.,MALE
498,498,498,498,498,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. ",MALE
499,499,499,499,499,STEVE ROGERS,The Stark Tower? That big ugly building in New York?,MALE
500,500,500,500,500,BRUCE BANNER,"It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? ",MALE
501,501,501,501,501,TONY STARK,"It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. ",MALE
502,502,502,502,502,BRUCE BANNER,"So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? ",MALE
503,503,503,503,503,TONY STARK,I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.,MALE
504,504,504,504,504,STEVE ROGERS,I’m sorry did you say-,MALE
505,505,505,505,505,TONY STARK,JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?,MALE
506,506,506,506,506,STEVE ROGERS,Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.,MALE
507,507,507,507,507,TONY STARK,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. ",MALE
508,508,508,508,508,STEVE ROGERS,"I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. ",MALE
509,509,509,509,509,TONY STARK,Following’s not really my style.,MALE

518,518,518,518,518,TONY STARK,"Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. ",MALE
519,519,519,519,519,BRUCE BANNER,"Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. ",MALE

521,521,521,521,521,BRUCE BANNER,But you can control it.,MALE
522,522,522,522,522,TONY STARK,Because I learned how.,MALE

525,525,525,525,525,BRUCE BANNER,So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?,MALE
526,526,526,526,526,TONY STARK,I guess we’ll find out.,MALE
527,527,527,527,527,BRUCE BANNER,You may not enjoy that.,MALE
528,528,528,528,528,TONY STARK,And you just might.,MALE

530,530,530,530,530,PHIL COULSON,"...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe. ",MALE
531,531,531,531,531,THOR,Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.,MALE
532,532,532,532,532,PHIL COULSON,He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.,MALE
533,533,533,533,533,THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. ",MALE

537,537,537,537,537,THOR,"Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.  When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. ",MALE
538,538,538,538,538,NICK FURY,War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?,MALE
539,539,539,539,539,THOR,"I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. ",MALE

561,561,561,561,561,LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic.",MALE
562,562,562,562,562,LOKI,...You lie and kill in the service of liars...,MALE

565,565,565,565,565,LOKI,"I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.  And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! ",MALE
566,566,566,566,566,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’re a monster!,FEMALE
