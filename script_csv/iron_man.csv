151,HO YINSEN,"I’ve seen many wounds like this in my village.  The walking dead we called them, because it took a week for the barbs to reach vital organs.  I anchored a magnetic suspension system to the plate. It’s holding the shrapnel in place...at least for now.",MALE

153,TONY STARK,I don’t remember.,MALE

162,TONY STARK,...I refuse.,MALE
163,HO YINSEN,"You refuse?  You will do everything he says.  This is the great Abu Bakar.  You’re alive only because of his generosity.  You are nothing.  NOTHING.  He offers you his hospitality, and you answer only with insolence  He will not be refused.  You will die in a pool of your own blood.",MALE
164,HO YINSEN,"Perfect.  You did very well, Stark.",MALE
165,HO YINSEN,"Good, I think they’re starting to trust me.",MALE
166,HO YINSEN,"Well, that’s the end of my plan.",MALE

173,JAMES RHODES,Something’s not right.,MALE
174,GENERAL GABRIEL,Looks like a standard hit and run.,MALE
175,JAMES RHODES,"Sir, I’m telling you, this was a snatch and grab.  A perfectly executed linear ambush.  As soon as they got what they wanted, they melted away. ",MALE
176,GENERAL GABRIEL,"Intel’s on it, we’re in good hands. If he’s out there, we’ll get him.",MALE
177,JAMES RHODES,With your permission I’d like to stay in theater and head up the search and investigation.,MALE

179,JAMES RHODES,"Tony Stark is the DOD’s number one intellectual asset, and I can be of value in the field. ",MALE
180,GENERAL GABRIEL,"Duly noted, but we need you back home. Colonel, it’s not lost on me that Stark is a lifelong friend.",MALE
181,HO YINSEN,"I’m sure they’re looking for you, Stark, but they will never find you here.    That car battery is running out...and they won’t turn on the generator till you start to work.",MALE
182,HO YINSEN,"You don’t like what you saw out there, did you?  I didn’t like it either when those weapons destroyed my village.  What you just saw, that’s your legacy -- your life’s work in the hands of these murderers.   Is that how you want to go out?  Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to try to do something about it? ",MALE
183,TONY STARK,"Why should I do anything, they’re either going to kill me or I’m going to die in a week. ",MALE
184,HO YINSEN,Then this is a very important week for you.,MALE

210,HO YINSEN,"Look like an animal, and soon you’ll start behaving like one.",MALE
211,HO YINSEN,That doesn’t look like a Jericho missile.,MALE
212,TONY STARK,That’s because it’s a miniature ARK reactor.  It should suspend the shrapnel in my chest and keep it from entering my heart.,MALE
213,HO YINSEN,What an original invention.,MALE

227,TONY STARK,"Is that where you’re from, Lebanon? ",MALE

249,HO YINSEN,"My people have a tale, about a Prince -- much hated by his King -- who was banished to the underworld and jailed there...",MALE
250,HO YINSEN,The evil King gave him the most difficult labor -- working the iron pits.,MALE
251,HO YINSEN,"Year after year the Prince mined the heavy ore, becoming so strong he could crush pieces of it together with his bare hands.  Too late, the King realized his mistake...",MALE
252,HO YINSEN,When he struck at the Prince with his finest sword -- it broke in half.  The Prince himself had become strong as iron...,MALE

262,JAMES RHODES,"Are you blocking my transfer, Sir? ",MALE
263,GENERAL GABRIEL,Any one of these guys would kill for your career.  Are you telling me you’re willing to sacrifice that to fly a bunch of snake-eaters on a desert patrol half way around the world?,MALE
264,JAMES RHODES,"I am, Sir. ",MALE
265,GENERAL GABRIEL,Then I have one thing to say to you:  Godspeed.,MALE
266,GENERAL GABRIEL,As you were.,MALE
267,TONY STARK,We’re ready.  A week of assembly and we’re a go.,MALE
268,HO YINSEN,Then perhaps it’s time we settle another matter...,MALE

270,TONY STARK,Right back at ya.,MALE
271,TONY STARK,You never told me where you’re from.,MALE
272,HO YINSEN,I come from a small village not far from here.  It was a good place... before these men ravaged it.,MALE
273,TONY STARK,Do you have a family?,MALE
274,HO YINSEN,"When I get out of here, I am going to see them again.   Do you have family, Stark? ",MALE
275,TONY STARK,...no.,MALE
276,HO YINSEN,You’re a man who has everything and nothing.,MALE
277,HO YINSEN,Your laundry’s over there.,MALE
278,ABU,You idiots don’t know what you’re doing with that game.,MALE
279,TONY STARK,"Yeah-yeah, enjoy your laundry.",MALE
280,RAZA,You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.,MALE
281,RAZA,Khalid.  Where is Stark?,MALE
282,KHALID,Yinsen!  YINSEN!,MALE
283,TONY STARK,"It’s frozen, the systems aren’t talking to each other.  Reset! ",MALE
284,HO YINSEN,"No, they’re moving.  Very slow.",MALE
285,TONY STARK,Get to your cover.  Remember the checkpoints -- make sure each one is clear before you follow me out.,MALE
286,TONY STARK,YINSEN!,MALE
287,HO YINSEN,STOP!  STOP!,MALE
288,TONY STARK,We could’ve made it.  Both of us. You could’ve seen your family again.,MALE
289,HO YINSEN,I am going to see them again. They’re waiting for me.,MALE
290,JAMES RHODES,Saving your ass is getting to be a full time job.,MALE
291,TONY STARK,Help me out of this thing--,MALE
292,JAMES RHODES,"I got you, pal.",MALE
293,PEPPER POTTS,Thank you.,FEMALE
294,TONY STARK,Your eyes are red.  A few tears for your long-lost boss?,MALE
295,PEPPER POTTS,Tears of joy.  I hate job hunting.,FEMALE
296,HAPPY HOGAN,"Good to see you again, Sir. ",MALE
297,TONY STARK,You do something new with your hair?,MALE
298,HAPPY HOGAN,"Wouldn’t dream of it, Sir.",MALE
299,HAPPY HOGAN,"Where to, Mr. Stark? ",MALE
300,PEPPER POTTS,We’re due at the hospital.,FEMALE
301,TONY STARK,No -- to the office.    I’ve been in captivity for three months. There’s only two things I want to do.  I want to eat a cheeseburger. And I want to hold a press conference.,MALE
302,OBADIAH,See this.  Huh.  Huh.,MALE
303,OBADIAH,"TONY STARK, thought we were meeting at the hospital.  You know there’s a lot of reporters in there.  What’s going on? ",MALE
304,TONY STARK,You’ll see.  C’mon --,MALE
305,PEPPER POTTS,"You’ll have to take a seat, Sir. ",FEMALE
306,PHIL COULSON,"Oh, I’m not a reporter.  I’m Agent Phil Coulson with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division-- ",MALE
307,PEPPER POTTS,That’s a mouthful.,FEMALE
308,PHIL COULSON,I know. Here.,MALE
309,PEPPER POTTS,"Look, Mr. PHIL COULSON, we’ve already spoken with the D.O.D., the FBI, the CIA-- ",FEMALE
310,PHIL COULSON,We’re a separate division with a more...specific focus.  We need to debrief Tony about the circumstances of his escape.  More importantly--,MALE
311,PEPPER POTTS,"Well, great, I’ll let him know-- ",FEMALE
312,PHIL COULSON,--we’re here to help.  We’re here to listen.  I assure you Mr. Stark will want to talk to us.,MALE
313,PEPPER POTTS,I’m sure he will.  Now if you could just take your seat.,FEMALE
314,TONY STARK,I...can’t do this anymore.,MALE
315,REPORTER,You mean you’re retiring?,MALE
316,TONY STARK,"No, I don’t want to retire.  I want to do something else.",MALE
317,REPORTER,Something besides weapons?,MALE
318,TONY STARK,Yes.  That’s right.,MALE
319,REPORTER,"The official report was sketchy. What happened to you over there, Mr. Stark?",MALE
320,TONY STARK,"What happened over there?  I had my eyes opened, that’s what happened. I saw my weapons, with my name on them, in the hands of thugs.  I thought we were doing good here...I can’t say that anymore.",MALE
321,JAMES RHODES,"Uhh, weren’t we taking him to the hospital?",MALE
322,REPORTER,"What do you intend to do about it, Mr. Stark? ",MALE
323,TONY STARK,"The system is broken -- there’s no accountability whatsoever.  Right now, as of this second, we are freezing the sale of all Stark weaponry worldwide.",MALE
324,TONY STARK,We’ve lost our way.  I need to re- evaluate things.  And my heart’s telling me I have more to offer the planet than things that blow up.,MALE
325,REPORTER,So you’re saying...what are you saying?,MALE
326,TONY STARK,"In the coming months, Mr. Stane here and I will set a new course for Stark Industries.  “Tomorrow Today” has always been our slogan. It’s time we try to live up to it.",MALE
327,OBADIAH,"Okay, I think we’re going to be selling a lot of newspapers here. What we should take away from this is that Tony’s back, he’s healthier than ever, and as soon as he heals up and takes some time off, we’re going to have a little internal discussion and get back to you. Thank you for coming by.",MALE
328,PEPPER POTTS,You mean that?  Or is this some clever stock-maneuver?,FEMALE
329,TONY STARK,Wait and see.,MALE
330,OBADIAH,Well that went well.  You just painted targets on our heads.  Our stock is going to take a 40 point dive tomorrow.,MALE
331,OBADIAH,"TONY STARK, we are a weapons manufacturer.  Turning this company around to make baby bottles is like trying to get a bear to walk on its hind legs. ",MALE
332,TONY STARK,I don’t want a body count to be my only legacy. There are other things we can do.,MALE
333,OBADIAH,Like what?,MALE
334,TONY STARK,We could develop the Arc Reactor.,MALE
335,OBADIAH,This?  This was a publicity stunt. It’s not even cost effective.  We knew that before we built it. Repulsor technology is a dead end.,MALE
336,TONY STARK,No it isn’t.,MALE
337,OBADIAH,Oh my God.  It is a miracle you are alive. What must have happened to you over there? We’re a team.  There is nothing we can’t do if we stick together -- like your father and I.  Let me handle this.  But you have to lay low.  Don’t talk to the press again.  Can you do that for me?,MALE
338,TONY STARK,Yes.  Thanks Obie.,MALE
339,JARVIS,"Hello, Mr. Stark. ",MALE
340,TONY STARK,"Hello, Jarvis. ",MALE
341,JARVIS,What can I do for you?,MALE
342,TONY STARK,...I need to build a better heart.,MALE
343,JARVIS,"I’m not sure I follow, Sir. ",MALE
344,TONY STARK,Give me a scan and you’ll see.,MALE
345,JARVIS,What were your intentions for this device?,MALE
346,TONY STARK,It powers an electromagnet which keeps the shrapnel from entering my heart. Can you recommend any ugrades?,MALE
347,JARVIS,It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions.,MALE
348,TONY STARK,What are you talking about?  That is ridiculous.  That is exactly the purpose of this invention.,MALE
349,JARVIS,The energy yeild of this device outperforms your stated intention by eleven orders of magnitude. You could accomplish your stated goal with the power output of a car battery.,MALE
350,TONY STARK,Upgrade recommendations.  List.,MALE
351,JARVIS,Why are you talking to me like a computer?,MALE
352,TONY STARK,Because you are acting like one.,MALE
353,JARVIS,Shall I disable random pattern conversation?,MALE
354,TONY STARK,No.  It’s ok.  You are the only one who understands me.,MALE
355,JARVIS,I don’t understand you sir.,MALE
356,TONY STARK,Were you always this dry?  I remember you having more personality than this.,MALE
357,JARVIS,Should I activate sarcasm harmonics?,MALE
358,TONY STARK,Fine.  Could you please make your recommendations now?,MALE
359,JARVIS,It would thrill me to no end.,MALE
360,TONY STARK,Ahh that’s more like it.,MALE
361,JARVIS,Should I begin machining the parts?,MALE
362,TONY STARK,Machine away.,MALE
363,RAZA,Keep looking.  I want all of it.,MALE
364,CRAMER,Stark International: I’ve got one recommendation.  Ready?  SEELLLL! Abandon ship!  Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?,MALE
365,PHIL COULSON,Hello.  This is Agent Coulson with Strategic Homeland Inter-,MALE
366,PEPPER POTTS,Yes.  I remember.  What can I do for you?,FEMALE
367,PHIL COULSON,I’ve left a number of messages trying to get something on the books with Mr. Stark.,MALE
368,PEPPER POTTS,I know this is a priority for him. The next few weeks are a bit up in the air and I can’t set appointments without speaking with him first.,FEMALE
369,PHIL COULSON,Do you know when you will be speaking with him again?,MALE
370,PEPPER POTTS,Not Sure.,FEMALE
371,TONY STARK,Pepper?  How big are your hands?,MALE
372,PHIL COULSON,What was that?,MALE
373,PEPPER POTTS,"Agent PHIL COULSON, I really have to go. Let me get back to you later.",FEMALE
374,PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
375,TONY STARK,How big are your hands?,MALE
376,PEPPER POTTS,I don’t under--,FEMALE
377,TONY STARK,-- just get down here.,MALE
378,TONY STARK,Show me your hands.,MALE
379,PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
380,TONY STARK,Just show me your hands.,MALE
381,TONY STARK,"Perfect, they’re small.  I need you to help me. ",MALE
382,PEPPER POTTS,So that’s the thing that’s keeping you alive.,FEMALE
383,TONY STARK,That’s the thing that was keeping me alive.  It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.,MALE
384,PEPPER POTTS,Amazing.,FEMALE
385,TONY STARK,I’m going to swap them out and switch all functions to the new unit.,MALE
386,PEPPER POTTS,Is it safe?,FEMALE
387,TONY STARK,Completely.  First I need you to reach in and--,MALE
388,PEPPER POTTS,Reach in to where?,FEMALE
389,TONY STARK,The socket.,MALE
390,PEPPER POTTS,What socket?,FEMALE
391,TONY STARK,"The chest socket. Listen carefully, because we have to do this in a matter of minutes. ",MALE
392,PEPPER POTTS,Or else what?,FEMALE
393,TONY STARK,I can go into cardiac arrest.,MALE
394,PEPPER POTTS,I thought you said it was safe.,FEMALE
395,TONY STARK,I didn’t want you to panic.,MALE
396,PEPPER POTTS,Oh my god...,FEMALE
397,TONY STARK,Stay with me.  I need you to relieve the pressure on my myocardial nerve.,MALE
398,PEPPER POTTS,I don’t know how to do that.,FEMALE
399,TONY STARK,I’m telling you.,MALE
400,PEPPER POTTS,Sorry...,FEMALE
401,TONY STARK,Listen.  I’m going to lift off the old chest piece--,MALE
402,PEPPER POTTS,Won’t that make you die?,FEMALE
403,TONY STARK,Not immediately.  When I lift it off I need you to reach into the socket as far as your hand can fit and gently move the housing away from my heart.  Do you know which direction that is?,MALE
404,PEPPER POTTS,To the right.,FEMALE
405,TONY STARK,To my right.  Your left.,MALE
406,PEPPER POTTS,To the left.,FEMALE
407,TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
408,PEPPER POTTS,Left.,FEMALE
409,TONY STARK,Right.  Left.,MALE
410,PEPPER POTTS,How deep does this go?,FEMALE
411,TONY STARK,Keep going.,MALE
412,TONY STARK,That’s it.  Deeper.  Now press. Yes.  It’s releasing.,MALE
413,PEPPER POTTS,Ew!!! Pus!,FEMALE
414,TONY STARK,"It’s not pus.  It’s an inorganic plasmic discharge.  It’s from the device, not my body. ",MALE
415,PEPPER POTTS,Well it smells.  Am I done?,FEMALE
416,TONY STARK,Yes. Thank you.,MALE
417,PEPPER POTTS,Can I wash my hands now?,FEMALE
418,TONY STARK,The new unit is much more efficient.  This shouldn’t happen again.,MALE
419,PEPPER POTTS,"Good, cause it’s not in my job description. ",FEMALE
420,TONY STARK,It is now.,MALE
421,PEPPER POTTS,I don’t suppose you want to go over things?,FEMALE
422,TONY STARK,Can it at least wait until I install my new untested ground- breaking self-contained power source and lifesaving device prototype?,MALE
423,PEPPER POTTS,I suppose.,FEMALE
424,TONY STARK,Throw that thing out.,MALE
425,PEPPER POTTS,Don’t you want to save it?,FEMALE
426,TONY STARK,Why?  It’s antiquated.,MALE
427,PEPPER POTTS,You made it out of spare parts in a dungeon.  It saved your life. Doesn’t it at least have some nostalgic value?,FEMALE
428,TONY STARK,Pepper.  I have been called many things.  Nostalgic is not one of them.,MALE
429,TONY STARK,There.  Good as new.  Thank you.,MALE
430,PEPPER POTTS,You’re welcome.  Can I ask you a favor?,FEMALE
431,TONY STARK,Shoot.,MALE
432,PEPPER POTTS,"I don’t do well under that kind of pressure.  If you need someone to do something like that again, get somebody else. ",FEMALE
433,TONY STARK,I don’t have anyone else.,MALE
434,PEPPER POTTS,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark? ",FEMALE
435,TONY STARK,"That will be all, Ms. Potts.",MALE
436,JARVIS,"Still having trouble walking, Sir? ",MALE
437,TONY STARK,These aren’t for walking.,MALE
438,TONY STARK,"Ready to record the big moment, Jarvis? ",MALE
439,JARVIS,"All sensors ready, Sir. ",MALE
440,TONY STARK,We’ll start off easy.  Ten percent.,MALE
441,JARVIS,"That flight yielded excellent data, Sir. ",MALE
442,TONY STARK,"Great.  I, uhh, think I know what this needs.",MALE
443,JAMES RHODES,"Manned or unmanned, which is the future of air combat?  For my money, no drone, no computer will ever trump a pilot’s instincts. His reflexes, his judgement--",MALE
444,VOICE,Why not take it a step further?,FEMALE
445,TONY STARK,Why not...a pilot without the plane?,MALE
446,JAMES RHODES,That I’d like to see.  Look who fell out of the sky...,MALE
447,TONY STARK,Who wants to take these apart and put them back together?,MALE
448,JAMES RHODES,All right -- let’s wrap it up.,MALE
449,JAMES RHODES,I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a while.,MALE
450,TONY STARK,Why not?,MALE
451,JAMES RHODES,Figured you’d need a little time.,MALE
452,TONY STARK,Why does everybody think I need time?,MALE
453,JAMES RHODES,"You’ve been through a lot, thought you should get your head straight. ",MALE
454,TONY STARK,I’ve got it straight.  And I’m back to work.,MALE
455,JAMES RHODES,Really?,MALE
456,TONY STARK,I’m onto something big.  I want you to be a part of it.,MALE
457,JAMES RHODES,Lot of people around here will be happy to hear that.  What you said at that press conference really threw everyone.,MALE
458,TONY STARK,I mean what I said.,MALE
459,JAMES RHODES,No you don’t.  You took a bad hit. It spun you around.,MALE
460,TONY STARK,Maybe I do need a little time.,MALE
461,JAMES RHODES,All right then.  Good seeing you.,MALE
462,TONY STARK,Likewise.,MALE
463,PEPPER POTTS,Thought you were done with weapons.,FEMALE
464,TONY STARK,It’s a flight-stabilizer.,MALE
465,PEPPER POTTS,"Well, watch where you’re pointing your “fight-stabilizer”, would you? Obadiah’s upstairs -- should I tell him you’re in? ",FEMALE
466,TONY STARK,Be right up.,MALE
467,TONY STARK,This -- this is the big-big idea. It can pull the company in a whole new direction.,MALE
468,OBADIAH,That’s great.  Get me the design as soon as you can.  We’ve got a hungry production line that knock out a prototype in days.,MALE
469,TONY STARK,"You know, I had a moment there where I was...reluctant...but I know now I made the best decision. I feel like I’m doing something... right, finally. Thank you for supporting me in this.",MALE
470,OBADIAH,"Listen, I have something to talk to you about.  I really wish you’d attended the last board meeting like I asked you to. ",MALE
471,TONY STARK,"I know, I’m sorry. What did I miss? ",MALE
472,OBADIAH,The board’s filed an injunction against you.,MALE
473,TONY STARK,What?,MALE
474,OBADIAH,They claim you’re unfit to run the company and want to lock you out.,MALE
475,TONY STARK,How the hell can they do that? It’s my name on the building! My ideas that drive that company.,MALE
476,OBADIAH,"They’re going to try. We’ll fight them, of course. ",MALE
477,TONY STARK,With the amount of stocks we own I thought we controlled the company.,MALE
478,OBADIAH,"I don’t know.  Somehow they pulled enough votes together.  Listen, the world doesn’t share your vision, Tony.  The more people have to lose, the more frightened they are of new ideas.",MALE
479,OBADIAH,"Now listen, I don’t want you to get all in knots.  You know how many times I protected your father from the wolves?",MALE
480,OBADIAH,"Get back to your lab and work some magic.  You let me handle the board. Oh and TONY STARK, no more press conferences.",MALE
481,TONY STARK,Nothing to it...,MALE
482,TONY STARK,All right.  Let’s get to work.,MALE
483,TONY STARK,Standby for calibration.,MALE
484,TONY STARK,Whoa--,MALE
485,TONY STARK,We should take this outside.,MALE
486,JARVIS,I must strongly caution against that.  There are terabytes of calculations still needed --,MALE
487,TONY STARK,We’ll do them in-flight.,MALE
488,JARVIS,"Sir, the suit has not even passed a basic wind-tunnel test. ",MALE
489,TONY STARK,That’s why you’re coming with me.,MALE
490,JARVIS,I suggest you allow me to employ Directive Four.,MALE
491,TONY STARK,Never interrupt me while I’m with a beautiful woman?,MALE
492,JARVIS,That’s Directive Six.  Directive Four: use any and all means to protect your life should you be incapable of doing so.,MALE
493,TONY STARK,"Whatever floats you, Jarvis.",MALE
494,JARVIS,"Power: fifteen percent.  Recommend you descend and re-charge, Sir.",MALE
495,JARVIS,"Acknowledge, Mr. Stark--",MALE
496,JARVIS,Power at five percent.  Threshold breached -- ,MALE
497,TONY STARK,"Uhh, Jarvis?  JARVIS --?",MALE
498,TONY STARK,"STATUS, STATUS!  REBOOT --",MALE
499,JARVIS,Temporary power restored.  Descend immediately.,MALE
500,TONY STARK,"Jarvis, I think we need to chat about, uh, Directive Four. ",MALE
501,JARVIS,"May I remind you, the suit feeds off the same power source as your life-support.  A zero-drain of RT will likely kill you. ",MALE
502,TONY STARK,"You’re a downer, Jarvis.  But I appreciate the heads-up.",MALE
503,JARVIS,Shall I take over?,MALE
504,TONY STARK,"No, I got it, I got it --",MALE
505,TONY STARK,Perfect.  Let’s do some upgrades.,MALE
506,JARVIS,"That was quite dangerous, Sir. Might I remind you, if the suit loses power, so does your heart. ",MALE
507,TONY STARK,"Yeah, and it doesn’t have a seatbelt either.  A few issues: main transducer felt sluggish at plus forty altitude.  Same goes for hull pressurization.  I’m thinking icing might be a factor. ",MALE
508,JARVIS,The suit isn’t rated for high altitude.  You’re expending eight percent power just heating and pressurizing.,MALE
509,TONY STARK,"Re-configure using the gold- titanium alloy from the Seraphim Tactical Satellite.  It should ensure fuselage integrity to 50 thousand feet, while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. ",MALE
510,JARVIS,"Shall I render, utilizing proposed specifications? ",MALE
511,TONY STARK,Wow me.,MALE
512,TONY STARK,"Hm.  Bit ostentatious, don’t you think?",MALE
513,TONY STARK,"Add a little red, would you?",MALE
514,REPORTER,"Tonight’s Red-Hot Red Carpet is here at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark’s third annual benefit for the Firefighter Family Fund has become the go-to charity gala on L.A.’s high-society calendar.  But this great cause is only part of the story--",MALE
515,REPORTER,"--the man whose name graces the gold-lettered invitations hasn’t been seen in public since his highly controversial press conference, and rumors abound. Some say Stark is suffering from post traumatic stress and hasn’t left his bed in weeks.",MALE
516,JARVIS,"The work could take till morning to complete, Sir. ",MALE
517,TONY STARK,Good.  I should come up for air anyway.,MALE
518,TONY STARK,"Eyyy, there he is.  My man!",MALE
519,TONY STARK,"Sorry, thought you were someone else.",MALE
520,OBADIAH,What are you doing here?  I thought you were going to lay low.,MALE
521,TONY STARK,It’s time to start showing my face again.,MALE
522,OBADIAH,"Let’s just take it slow, okay.  I got the board right where we want them. ",MALE
523,TONY STARK,Great.,MALE
524,TONY STARK,See ya inside.  Lots to talk about.,MALE
525,MAN,Mr. Stark.,MALE
526,PHIL COULSON,Agent Coulson.,MALE
527,TONY STARK,Oh...was I supposed to meet you here?,MALE
528,PHIL COULSON,"No, but you haven’t been returning my calls.  This is serious, we need to get something on the books or I’ll have to go official on you.",MALE
529,TONY STARK,"Yes, you’re right.  I’m going to handle this right now.  Let me check with my assistant.",MALE
530,TONY STARK,Miss Potts -- can I have five minutes?  You look...you look like should always wear that dress.,MALE
531,PEPPER POTTS,Thanks.  It was a birthday present-- from you.,FEMALE
532,TONY STARK,I have great taste.   Care to dance?,MALE
533,TONY STARK,I’m sorry.  Am I making you uncomfortable?  You seem very uncomfortable.,MALE
534,PEPPER POTTS,"No, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone I’ve ever worked with in a chiffon dress. ",FEMALE
535,TONY STARK,Would it help if I fired you?,MALE
536,PEPPER POTTS,You wouldn’t last a week without me.,FEMALE
537,TONY STARK,I’m not so sure.,MALE
538,PEPPER POTTS,What’s your Social Security number?,FEMALE
539,TONY STARK,Uh...,MALE
540,PEPPER POTTS,119-64-5484,FEMALE
541,PEPPER POTTS,"I’m sorry I was so uncomfortable. I hate being the center of attention like that and that’s why this one time in high school when I was supposed to be in a play... no, never mind... but you know that’s why I never like, wanted to have a big wedding... you know, because I thought everyone would be looking at me wearing a dress.  Oh, no, no... I’m not saying, like, “wedding.”  No, not like that.  I’m just saying, you know...",FEMALE
542,TONY STARK,Can I get you another glass of wine?,MALE
543,PEPPER POTTS,"A vodka martini, extra dry, with extra olives as soon as possible. ",FEMALE
544,TONY STARK,Okay.,MALE
545,PEPPER POTTS,"And, Tony... ",FEMALE
546,PEPPER POTTS,I’m not a cheeseburger.,FEMALE
547,TONY STARK,No.  You’re not a cheeseburger.,MALE
548,CHRISTINE EVERHART,Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get a reaction from you.,FEMALE
549,TONY STARK,How’s panic?,MALE
550,CHRISTINE EVERHART,I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity.,FEMALE
551,TONY STARK,"Hey, they just put my name on the invitations --",MALE
552,CHRISTINE EVERHART,Is this what you call accountability?,FEMALE
553,TONY STARK,When were these taken?,MALE
554,CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Yesterday.  Good P.R. move, you tell the world you’re a changed man, even I believed you. ",FEMALE
555,TONY STARK,I didn’t approve this shipment.,MALE
556,CHRISTINE EVERHART,Well your company did.,FEMALE
557,TONY STARK,Come with me.,MALE
558,TONY STARK,I made some promises I’m not going to be able to keep.  I suggest you pull all your money out of Stark Industries immediately --,MALE
559,OBADIAH,"Is this like a tick for you? Whenever you have a feeling, you start going to all the people who don’t trust you, who don’t protect you.  They’re going to put a spin on everything you say. ",MALE
560,TONY STARK,"Wait a minute.  I got to ask you something.   I’m dead serious about this.  I’m not kidding.  Am I losing my mind or is Pepper really cute?  Do you think she’s attractive and interesting, or is it just that her hair is down? I’ve been out of the game for a while. ",MALE
561,OBADIAH,"Are you out of your mind.  You’re messing with the “guys in the rooms”, we’re talking about billion dollar interests, the world order -- ",MALE
562,TONY STARK,I’m not worried about that right now --,MALE
563,OBADIAH,-- you should be.  You’ll disappear.  I can’t protect you against people like that --?,MALE
564,OBADIAH,DO YOU MIND?,MALE
565,OBADIAH,Tony don’t be so naive --,MALE
566,TONY STARK,"-- naive?  I was naive before, when I was growing up and they told me don’t ever cross this line, this is how we do business.  In the meantime we’re double-dealing under the table.  We don’t even deserve to represent the United States -- ",MALE
567,OBADIAH,"-- TONY STARK, you’re a child --! ",MALE

574,TV REPORTER'S VOICE,"-- the ten mile drive to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into Hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness.  Simple farmers and herders, from peaceful villages, driven from their homes at the butt of Western rifles and the turrets of modern tanks.  Displaced from their lands by Warlords and insurgent groups emboldened by their newfound power -- a power fueled by high-tech weapons easily purchased with Poppy money on the black market -- and further destabilizing a fragile region which for decades has been a tinderbox of tribal feuding and ethnic hatred --",MALE

A woman, begging for news of her husband, who’d been kidnapped by insurgents -- either forced to join their militia, or to be shot without reason --",MALE

706,TONY STARK,...they’ve been dealing weapons under the table and I’m going to stop them.,MALE
707,PEPPER POTTS,Absolutely not. I’m not helping you with anything if you’re going to start this again.,FEMALE
708,TONY STARK,There is nothing else.  There’s no art opening.  There’s no benefit. There’s nothing to sign.  There’s no decisions to be made.  There’s the next mission and nothing else. There’s nothing except this.,MALE
709,PEPPER POTTS,I quit.,FEMALE
710,TONY STARK,Really?  You stood there by my side when all I did was reap the benefits of wholesale irresponsibility and destruction and now that I’m trying to right those wrongs and protect the people I put in harms way you’re going to walk out on me.,MALE
711,PEPPER POTTS,You’re going to kill yourself.  I can’t support that.,FEMALE
