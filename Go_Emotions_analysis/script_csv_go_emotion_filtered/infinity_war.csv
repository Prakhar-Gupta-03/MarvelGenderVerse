ROCKET,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,What happened?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Looks like we're not getting paid.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,How the hell is this dude still alive?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,"He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,I'm muscular.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"Yeah, right.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,It's true. You have gained a little weight….,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

THOR,Who the hell are you guys?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,Including my own.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Your father killed my brother.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"I need a hammer, not a spoon…. How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,What are you doing?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

ROCKET,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,No.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,No I'm not.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,He just did it again!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

THOR,Stop it. You did it again.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,He's trying to copy me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Knowhere.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,He must be going somewhere.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Not anymore.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Or a genius.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,The 'Avengers'?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Earth's Mightiest Heroes.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,Like Kevin Bacon?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,That's a made up word.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,All words are made up.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Rabbit?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,You're very perceptive.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Wonderful.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,Except for that I'm the captain.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Quiet!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,That's my backpack.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Go sit down.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,"Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,The Thanos killing kind.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,A little bit. Yeah.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,He already is.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,So cool.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER QUILL,For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

SECRETARY ROSS,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SECRETARY ROSS,You have second thoughts?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,Not anymore.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Mr. Secretary.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SECRETARY ROSS,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could use some of that right now.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SECRETARY ROSS,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SECRETARY ROSS,Arrest them.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,"All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"You too, Rhodey.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SAM WILSON,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hi, Bruce.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,Nat.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
SAM WILSON,This is awkward.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
WANDA MAXIMOFF,And they can clearly find us.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,Who's Scott?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Ant-Man.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well then, we have to protect it.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
VISION,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
VISION,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
WANDA MAXIMOFF,That's too high a price.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
VISION,Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
VISION,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Can we do that?,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,Not me. Not here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
JAMES RHODES,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I know somewhere.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
OKOYE,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
T'CHALA,And the Border Tribe?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
OKOYE,Those that are left.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
T'CHALA,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
OKOYE,And what of this one?,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
T'CHALA,This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BUCKY,Where's the fight?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
T'CHALA,On its way.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EBONY MAW,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,What the--,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,I know what you're gonna say.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,You should not be here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,I was gonna go home--,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,And now I gotta hear it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,What did you just say?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,No. I did think this through.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EBONY MAW,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EBONY MAW,...Could end your friend's life in an instant.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EBONY MAW,You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,Yes! Wait what are those?!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,We've gotta turn this ship around.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,"No, I want to protect the stone.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,I'm backup.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"No. I'm Peter, by the way.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,Dr. Strange.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Yeah?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,Can you get us home?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,I thought you might be hungry.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,I always hated that chair.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,I was a child when you took me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,I saved you.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Because you murdered half the planet.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,A small price to pay for salvation.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,You're insane.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,You don't know that!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,"I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,I'm sorry I disappointed you.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Nebula.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Don't do this.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Please don't do this.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NEBULA,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,He can never get them all.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NEBULA,He will!,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GAMORA,Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THANOS,Show me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,You speak Groot?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,And you said your sister and your dad?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Both dead.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Still got a mom, though?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Killed by a dark elf.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,A best friend?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Stabbed through the heart.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Well, he's never fought me.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Yeah, he has!",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Better be some hammer.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,And what if you're wrong?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,What's this?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,He gave you his eye?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Thank you, sweet rabbit.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,It ain't the eye.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Yes. Why?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ROCKET,Look anything like that?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Go back to the pod.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Eitri, wait! Stop!",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EITRI,Thor?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,What happened here?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EITRI,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
EITRI,"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.'",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NEBULA,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

STEPHEN STRANGE,I think we're here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Yep, got it.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,Okay. Okay. Ready.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,You alright?  That was close. I owe you one.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PETER PARKER,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DRAX,THANOS!!!!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

DRAX,"Do it, Quill! I can take it.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MANTIS,"No, he can't take it!",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
