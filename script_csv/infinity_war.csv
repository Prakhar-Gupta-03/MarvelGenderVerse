I repeat, this is not a warcraft!",MALE
1,EBONY MAW,"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.",MALE
2,THANOS,"I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.",MALE
3,THOR,You talk too much.,MALE
4,THANOS,"The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.",MALE
5,LOKI,"Oh, I do. Kill away!",MALE
6,LOKI,"ALL RIGHT, STOP!",MALE
7,THOR,We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.,MALE
8,THOR,You really are the worst brother.,MALE
9,LOKI,"I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.",MALE

30,WONG,Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.,MALE

49,TONY STARK,Yes.,MALE
50,PEPPER POTTS,Yeah. Everybody has that.,FEMALE
51,TONY STARK,"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?",MALE

83,TONY STARK,Tell me his name again.,MALE
84,BRUCE BANNER,"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.",MALE
85,TONY STARK,This is it... What's our timeline?,MALE
86,BRUCE BANNER,"No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...",MALE
87,STEPHEN STRANGE,He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.,MALE
88,TONY STARK,"Did you seriously just say ""hitherto undreamt of""?",MALE
89,STEPHEN STRANGE,Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?,MALE
90,TONY STARK,Is that what this is.... ?,MALE
91,TONY STARK,"I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?",MALE

99,BRUCE BANNER,That's a thing?,MALE
100,TONY STARK,Whatever. Point is: things change.,MALE

105,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Protecting your reality, douchebag.",MALE
106,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.",MALE
107,TONY STARK,"Yeah, that's the... thing.",MALE
108,BRUCE BANNER,What do you mean?,MALE
109,TONY STARK,"Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.",MALE

126,TONY STARK,"Help him! Wong, Doc.",MALE
127,BRUCE BANNER,Go! Got it!,MALE

129,FRIDAY,"Not sure, I'm working on it.",MALE
130,TONY STARK,"Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!",MALE
131,STEPHEN STRANGE,Might wanna use it.,MALE
132,PETER PARKER,"Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.",MALE
133,NED LEEDS,Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!,MALE
134,STAN LEE,What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?,MALE

151,TONY STARK,There's no time for a thing.,MALE
152,BRUCE BANNER,I know.,MALE
153,TONY STARK,That's the thing right there. Let's go.,MALE
154,TONY STARK,"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.",MALE
155,BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't--",MALE
156,TONY STARK,"It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.",MALE
157,WONG,I have him.,MALE
158,BRUCE BANNER,Damn it.,MALE

169,BRUCE BANNER,"Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!",MALE
170,HULK,Nooooooo!,MALE
171,BRUCE BANNER,"What do you mean, ""no""?!",MALE
172,PETER PARKER,"Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?",MALE
173,TONY STARK,"Kid, where'd you come from?",MALE
174,PETER PARKER,Field trip to MoMA.,MALE
175,PETER PARKER,"What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?",MALE
176,TONY STARK,He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.,MALE
177,EBONY MAW,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.,MALE
178,STEPHEN STRANGE,It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.,MALE
179,EBONY MAW,Then I'll take it off your corpse.,MALE
180,STEPHEN STRANGE,You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.,MALE
181,EBONY MAW,You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!,MALE
182,TONY STARK,"Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.",MALE
183,PETER PARKER,On it!,MALE
184,PETER PARKER,Not cool!,MALE
185,PETER PARKER,"Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!",MALE
186,TONY STARK,"Hang on, kid.",MALE
187,TONY STARK,"Wong, you're invited to my wedding.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y.",MALE
188,TONY STARK,"Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.",MALE
189,PETER PARKER,But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!,MALE
190,TONY STARK,You're too high up. You're running out of air.,MALE
191,PETER PARKER,Yeah! That makes sense.,MALE
192,PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!",MALE
193,TONY STARK,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.",MALE
194,FRIDAY,Yep.,MALE
195,PETER PARKER,"OH, COME ON!",MALE

197,PEPPER POTTS,"Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?",FEMALE
198,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.",MALE
199,PEPPER POTTS,Why?,FEMALE
200,TONY STARK,Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.,MALE
201,PEPPER POTTS,Tell me you're not on that ship.,FEMALE
202,TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
203,PEPPER POTTS,"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.",FEMALE
204,TONY STARK,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.",MALE
205,PEPPER POTTS,"Come back here, Tony. I swear to God….",FEMALE
206,TONY STARK,Pep….,MALE
207,PEPPER POTTS,Come back here right now! Come back!,FEMALE
208,FRIDAY,"Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too….",MALE
209,PETER PARKER,Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus....,MALE
210,BRUCE BANNER,Where you going?,MALE
211,WONG,The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?,MALE
212,BRUCE BANNER,I'm gonna make a call.,MALE
213,PETER QUILL,"Sing it, Drax!",MALE
214,ROCKET,Why are we doing this again?,MALE
215,GAMORA,"It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.",MALE
216,ROCKET,"I get that, but why are we doing it?",MALE
217,PETER QUILL,Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese  for our help.,MALE
218,GAMORA,Which isn't the point.,MALE
219,PETER QUILL,Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….,MALE
220,DRAX,We'll take his ship.,MALE
221,ROCKET,Exactly!,MALE
222,PETER QUILL,B-b-b-bingo!,MALE
223,MANTIS,We are arriving.,MALE
224,PETER QUILL,"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.  Groot.",MALE
225,GROOT,I am Groot!,MALE
226,PETER QUILL,Whoa!,MALE
227,ROCKET,Language!,MALE
228,GAMORA,Hey!,MALE
229,DRAX,Wow.,MALE
230,PETER QUILL,"You got some acorns on you, kid.",MALE
231,ROCKET,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!",MALE
232,MANTIS,What happened?,MALE
233,ROCKET,Looks like we're not getting paid.,MALE
234,ROCKET,Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!,MALE
235,PETER QUILL,How the hell is this dude still alive?,MALE
236,DRAX,"He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.",MALE
237,PETER QUILL,I'm muscular.,MALE
238,ROCKET,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.",MALE
239,PETER QUILL,"Yeah, right.",MALE
240,DRAX,It's true. You have gained a little weight….,MALE
241,PETER QUILL,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…",MALE
242,MANTIS,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.,MALE
243,DRAX,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.,MALE
244,PETER QUILL,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.,MALE
245,ROCKET,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?",MALE
246,GAMORA,It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.,MALE
247,PETER QUILL,Stop massaging his muscles.  Wake him up.,MALE
248,MANTIS,Wake.,MALE
249,THOR,Who the hell are you guys?,MALE
250,GAMORA,"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....",MALE
251,DRAX,Including my own.,MALE
252,GAMORA,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.",MALE
253,THOR,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.,MALE
254,DRAX,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.,MALE
255,THOR,Your father killed my brother.,MALE
256,PETER QUILL,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.",MALE
257,THOR,"Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.",MALE
258,PETER QUILL,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--",MALE
259,THOR,"I need a hammer, not a spoon…. How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….",MALE
260,PETER QUILL,What are you doing?,MALE
261,THOR,Taking your pod.,MALE
262,PETER QUILL,"No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.",MALE
263,ROCKET,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?,MALE
264,PETER QUILL,No.,MALE
265,DRAX,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.,MALE
266,PETER QUILL,No I'm not.,MALE
267,MANTIS,He just did it again!,MALE
268,PETER QUILL,This is my voice!,MALE
269,THOR,Are you mocking me?,MALE
270,PETER QUILL,Are you mocking me?,MALE
271,THOR,Stop it. You did it again.,MALE
272,PETER QUILL,He's trying to copy me.,MALE
273,THOR,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.,MALE
274,GAMORA,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.,MALE
275,THOR,Knowhere.,MALE
276,MANTIS,He must be going somewhere.,MALE
277,PETER QUILL,"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.",MALE
278,THOR,Not anymore.,MALE
279,GAMORA,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?,MALE
280,THOR,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.",MALE
281,PETER QUILL,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.",MALE
282,THOR,Or a genius.,MALE
283,GAMORA,How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?,MALE
284,THOR,"There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.",MALE
285,PETER QUILL,The 'Avengers'?,MALE
286,THOR,Earth's Mightiest Heroes.,MALE
287,MANTIS,Like Kevin Bacon?,MALE
288,THOR,"He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.",MALE
289,GAMORA,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.,MALE
290,THOR,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.",MALE
291,DRAX,That's a made up word.,MALE
292,THOR,All words are made up.,MALE
293,ROCKET,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.",MALE
294,THOR,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.",MALE
295,ROCKET,Rabbit?,MALE
296,THOR,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?",MALE
297,ROCKET,You're very perceptive.,MALE
298,THOR,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?,MALE
299,ROCKET,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.",MALE
300,THOR,Wonderful.,MALE
301,PETER QUILL,Except for that I'm the captain.,MALE
302,THOR,Quiet!,MALE
303,PETER QUILL,That's my backpack.,MALE
304,ROCKET,Go sit down.,MALE
305,PETER QUILL,"Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?",MALE
306,THOR,The Thanos killing kind.,MALE
307,PETER QUILL,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?,MALE
308,THOR,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.,MALE
309,ROCKET,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?,MALE
310,THOR,A little bit. Yeah.,MALE
311,GAMORA,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.",MALE
312,THOR,He already is.,MALE
313,ROCKET,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.",MALE
314,THOR,So cool.,MALE
315,PETER QUILL,For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.,MALE
316,ROCKET,"You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.",MALE
317,THOR,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.",MALE
318,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis? Is it the stone again?,FEMALE
319,VISION,It's as if it's speaking to me.,MALE
320,WANDA MAXIMOFF,What does it say?,FEMALE
321,VISION,I don't... I don't know. But something...,MALE
322,VISION,Tell me what you feel.,MALE
323,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I just feel you.,FEMALE
324,WANDA MAXIMOFF,So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.,FEMALE
325,VISION,What if I miss that train?,MALE
326,WANDA MAXIMOFF,There is an 11.,FEMALE
327,VISION,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?",MALE
328,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You gave Stark your word.,FEMALE
329,VISION,I'd rather give it to you.,MALE
330,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.",FEMALE
331,VISION,"Not to each other.  Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...",MALE
332,WANDA MAXIMOFF,It works.,FEMALE
333,VISION,It works.,MALE
334,VISION,Then stay. Stay with me.,MALE
335,VISION,Or not. If I'm overstepping…,MALE
336,WANDA MAXIMOFF,What are they?,FEMALE
337,VISION,What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.,MALE
338,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.",FEMALE
339,VISION,"Wanda, I…",MALE
340,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vision!,FEMALE
341,VISION,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.,MALE
342,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that even possible?,FEMALE
343,VISION,It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.,MALE
344,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis!,FEMALE
345,CORVUS GLAIVE,"Give up the Stone, and she lives.",MALE
346,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Hands off.,FEMALE
347,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.",FEMALE
348,VISION,Please. Please leave.,MALE
349,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.,FEMALE
350,VISION,Please.,MALE
351,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get up.,FEMALE
352,PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,Get up.,FEMALE
353,CORVUS GLAIVE,I can't.,MALE
354,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We don't wanna kill you. But we will.,FEMALE
355,PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,You'll never get the chance again.,FEMALE
356,SAM WILSON,Can you stand?,MALE
357,VISION,"Thank you, Captain.",MALE
358,STEVE ROGERS,Let's get you on the jet.,MALE
359,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.",FEMALE
360,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.,FEMALE
361,SAM WILSON,"Where to, Cap?",MALE
362,STEVE ROGERS,Home.,MALE
363,GAMORA'S MOTHER,Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.,FEMALE
364,EBONY MAW,Zehobereians…,MALE
365,GAMORA,Mother! Where's my mother?!,MALE
366,EBONY MAW,"Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.",MALE
367,GAMORA,Mother!,MALE
368,EBONY MAW,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.",MALE
369,THANOS,"What's wrong, little one?",MALE
370,GAMORA,My mother. Where is my mother?,MALE
371,THANOS,What's your name?,MALE
372,GAMORA,Gamora.,MALE
373,THANOS,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…  Here. You try.",MALE
374,EBONY MAW,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.",MALE
375,THANOS,Concentrate. There! You've got it.,MALE
376,PETER QUILL,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--",MALE
377,GAMORA,I need to ask a favor.,MALE
378,PETER QUILL,"Yeah, sure.",MALE
379,GAMORA,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.",MALE
380,PETER QUILL,Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?,MALE
381,GAMORA,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.,MALE
382,PETER QUILL,What?,MALE
383,GAMORA,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.,MALE
384,PETER QUILL,What do you know?,MALE
385,GAMORA,"If I tell you, you'd know, too.",MALE
386,PETER QUILL,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?",MALE
387,GAMORA,Only if you wanna die.,MALE
388,PETER QUILL,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?,MALE
389,GAMORA,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.",MALE
390,PETER QUILL,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would…",MALE
391,GAMORA,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.,MALE
392,PETER QUILL,Okay.,MALE
393,PETER QUILL,Dude. How long have you been standing there?,MALE
394,DRAX,An hour.,MALE
395,PETER QUILL,An hour? Are you serious?,MALE
396,DRAX,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.,MALE
397,PETER QUILL,You're eating a zarg-nut.,MALE
398,DRAX,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.,MALE
399,PETER QUILL,"Mmm, no.",MALE
400,DRAX,I'm sure I'm invisible.,MALE
401,MANTIS,"Hi, Drax.",MALE
402,DRAX,Damn it.,MALE
403,PETER QUILL,This place looks deserted.,MALE
404,DRAX,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.,MALE
405,PETER QUILL,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.",MALE
406,COLLECTOR,I don't have it.,MALE
407,THANOS,Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.,MALE
408,THANOS,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.",MALE
409,COLLECTOR,I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?,MALE
410,THANOS,I imagine it's like breathing for you.,MALE
411,COLLECTOR,Like suicide.,MALE
412,THANOS,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.,MALE
413,COLLECTOR,I didn't know what it was.,MALE
414,THANOS,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?",MALE
415,DRAX,Today...,MALE
416,PETER QUILL,Drax. Drax.,MALE
417,DRAX,...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.,MALE
418,PETER QUILL,"Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.",MALE
419,DRAX,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.,MALE
420,MANTIS,Sleeeep.,MALE
421,PETER QUILL,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!",MALE
422,THANOS,Why?  Why you? Daughter…,MALE
423,PETER QUILL,That was quick.,MALE
424,COLLECTOR,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!,MALE
425,THANOS,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.",MALE
426,THANOS,"That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.",MALE
427,GAMORA,You knew I'd come.,MALE
428,THANOS,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.",MALE
429,DRAX,Thanos!,MALE
430,PETER QUILL,"Let her go, Grimace!",MALE
431,GAMORA,Peter…,MALE
432,PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,MALE
433,GAMORA,Now? Really?,MALE
434,PETER QUILL,You let her go!,MALE
435,THANOS,"Ah, the boyfriend.",MALE
436,PETER QUILL,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.,MALE
437,GAMORA,Peter…,MALE
438,PETER QUILL,Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!,MALE
439,GAMORA,Not him.,MALE
440,GAMORA,You promised! You promised.,MALE
441,THANOS,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  DO IT!!",MALE
442,PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,MALE
443,GAMORA,"I love you, more than anything.",MALE
444,PETER QUILL,"I love you, too.",MALE
445,THANOS,I like you.,MALE
446,SECRETARY ROSS,Still no word from Vision?,MALE
447,JAMES RHODES,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.,MALE
448,SECRETARY ROSS,On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.,MALE
449,JAMES RHODES,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?",MALE
450,SECRETARY ROSS,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.",MALE
451,JAMES RHODES,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.",MALE
452,SECRETARY ROSS,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.",MALE
453,JAMES RHODES,That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.,MALE
454,SECRETARY ROSS,You have second thoughts?,MALE
455,JAMES RHODES,Not anymore.,MALE
456,STEVE ROGERS,Mr. Secretary.,MALE
457,SECRETARY ROSS,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.,MALE
458,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could use some of that right now.,FEMALE
459,SECRETARY ROSS,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?",MALE
460,STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.",MALE
461,SECRETARY ROSS,Arrest them.,MALE
462,JAMES RHODES,"All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.",MALE
463,STEVE ROGERS,"You too, Rhodey.",MALE
464,JAMES RHODES,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.,MALE
465,SAM WILSON,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.",MALE
466,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.",MALE
467,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hi, Bruce.",FEMALE
468,BRUCE BANNER,Nat.,MALE
469,SAM WILSON,This is awkward.,MALE
470,JAMES RHODES,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?",MALE
471,WANDA MAXIMOFF,And they can clearly find us.,FEMALE
472,BRUCE BANNER,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?,MALE
473,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.",FEMALE
474,BRUCE BANNER,Who's Scott?,MALE
475,STEVE ROGERS,Ant-Man.,MALE
476,BRUCE BANNER,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.",MALE
477,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well then, we have to protect it.",FEMALE
478,VISION,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail.",MALE
479,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.",FEMALE
480,VISION,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.,MALE
481,WANDA MAXIMOFF,That's too high a price.,FEMALE
482,VISION,Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.,MALE
483,STEVE ROGERS,"But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision.",MALE
484,VISION,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?",MALE
485,BRUCE BANNER,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.",MALE
486,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?,FEMALE
487,BRUCE BANNER,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.",MALE
488,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Can we do that?,FEMALE
489,BRUCE BANNER,Not me. Not here.,MALE
490,JAMES RHODES,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.",MALE
491,STEVE ROGERS,I know somewhere.,MALE
492,OKOYE,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.",FEMALE
493,T'CHALA,And the Border Tribe?,MALE
494,OKOYE,Those that are left.,FEMALE
495,T'CHALA,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.,MALE
496,OKOYE,And what of this one?,FEMALE
497,T'CHALA,This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.,MALE
498,BUCKY,Where's the fight?,MALE
499,T'CHALA,On its way.,MALE
500,EBONY MAW,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone.",MALE
501,TONY STARK,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?",MALE
502,PETER PARKER,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....",MALE
503,TONY STARK,What the--,MALE
504,PETER PARKER,I know what you're gonna say.,MALE
505,TONY STARK,You should not be here.,MALE
506,PETER PARKER,I was gonna go home--,MALE
507,TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear it.,MALE
508,PETER PARKER,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...,MALE
509,TONY STARK,And now I gotta hear it.,MALE
510,PETER PARKER,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.",MALE
511,TONY STARK,What did you just say?,MALE
512,PETER PARKER,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.,MALE
513,TONY STARK,Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE
514,PETER PARKER,No. I did think this through.,MALE
515,TONY STARK,You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE
516,PETER PARKER,"It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.",MALE
517,TONY STARK,Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.,MALE
518,PETER PARKER,"Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?",MALE
519,EBONY MAW,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...,MALE
520,EBONY MAW,...Could end your friend's life in an instant.,MALE
521,TONY STARK,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.",MALE
522,EBONY MAW,You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.,MALE
523,TONY STARK,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.",MALE
524,PETER PARKER,Yes! Wait what are those?!,MALE
525,PETER PARKER,"Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.",MALE
526,STEPHEN STRANGE,We've gotta turn this ship around.,MALE
527,TONY STARK,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.,MALE
528,STEPHEN STRANGE,"No, I want to protect the stone.",MALE
529,TONY STARK,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.",MALE
530,STEPHEN STRANGE,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?,MALE
531,TONY STARK,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.,MALE
532,STEPHEN STRANGE,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.,MALE
533,TONY STARK,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.,MALE
534,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.",MALE
535,TONY STARK,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.",MALE
536,PETER PARKER,I'm backup.,MALE
537,TONY STARK,No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.,MALE
538,STEPHEN STRANGE,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?",MALE
539,PETER PARKER,"No. I'm Peter, by the way.",MALE
540,STEPHEN STRANGE,Dr. Strange.,MALE
541,PETER PARKER,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.",MALE
542,TONY STARK,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.,MALE
543,STEPHEN STRANGE,Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?,MALE
544,TONY STARK,Yeah?,MALE
545,STEPHEN STRANGE,Can you get us home?,MALE
546,TONY STARK,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.,MALE
547,STEPHEN STRANGE,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.,MALE
548,TONY STARK,"No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?",MALE
549,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.",MALE
550,TONY STARK,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.",MALE
551,THANOS,I thought you might be hungry.,MALE
552,GAMORA,I always hated that chair.,MALE
553,THANOS,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.,MALE
554,GAMORA,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.,MALE
555,THANOS,You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.,MALE
556,GAMORA,I was a child when you took me.,MALE
557,THANOS,I saved you.,MALE
558,GAMORA,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.,MALE
559,THANOS,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",MALE
560,GAMORA,Because you murdered half the planet.,MALE
561,THANOS,A small price to pay for salvation.,MALE
562,GAMORA,You're insane.,MALE
563,THANOS,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.",MALE
564,GAMORA,You don't know that!,MALE
565,THANOS,"I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.",MALE
566,GAMORA,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.,MALE
567,THANOS,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.",MALE
568,GAMORA,I'm sorry I disappointed you.,MALE
569,THANOS,I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied.,MALE
570,GAMORA,Nebula.,MALE
571,GAMORA,Don't do this.,MALE
572,THANOS,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.",MALE
573,GAMORA,Please don't do this.,MALE
574,THANOS,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.,MALE
575,GAMORA,Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.,MALE
576,NEBULA,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.",FEMALE
577,GAMORA,He can never get them all.,MALE
578,NEBULA,He will!,FEMALE
579,GAMORA,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.",MALE
580,THANOS,You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?,MALE
581,GAMORA,Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.,MALE
582,THANOS,Show me.,MALE
583,GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
584,ROCKET,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.,MALE
585,GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
586,THOR,"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.",MALE
587,ROCKET,You speak Groot?,MALE
588,THOR,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.",MALE
589,GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
590,THOR,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.,MALE
591,ROCKET,"Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.",MALE
592,THOR,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.",MALE
593,ROCKET,And you said your sister and your dad?,MALE
594,THOR,Both dead.,MALE
595,ROCKET,"Still got a mom, though?",MALE
596,THOR,Killed by a dark elf.,MALE
597,ROCKET,A best friend?,MALE
598,THOR,Stabbed through the heart.,MALE
599,ROCKET,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?,MALE
600,THOR,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.",MALE
601,ROCKET,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.",MALE
602,THOR,"Well, he's never fought me.",MALE
603,ROCKET,"Yeah, he has!",MALE
604,THOR,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.",MALE
605,ROCKET,Better be some hammer.,MALE
606,THOR,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.",MALE
607,ROCKET,And what if you're wrong?,MALE
608,THOR,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?,MALE
609,ROCKET,I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.,MALE
610,THOR,What's this?,MALE
611,ROCKET,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.,MALE
612,THOR,He gave you his eye?,MALE
613,ROCKET,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.,MALE
614,THOR,"Thank you, sweet rabbit.",MALE
615,ROCKET,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!",MALE
616,THOR,I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.,MALE
617,ROCKET,It ain't the eye.,MALE
618,THOR,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.,MALE
619,ROCKET,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.,MALE
620,THOR,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....,MALE
621,ROCKET,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?",MALE
622,THOR,Yes. Why?,MALE
623,ROCKET,Look anything like that?,MALE
624,GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
625,THOR,Go back to the pod.,MALE
626,THOR,"Eitri, wait! Stop!",MALE
627,EITRI,Thor?,MALE
628,THOR,What happened here?,MALE
629,EITRI,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!,MALE
630,THOR,"Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?",MALE
631,EITRI,"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.'",MALE
632,THOR,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.",MALE

726,RED SKULL,To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.,MALE
727,THANOS,Of what?,MALE

729,GAMORA,"All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy.

755,SHURI,I'm sure you did your best.,FEMALE
756,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Can you do it?,FEMALE
