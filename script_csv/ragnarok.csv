THOR,"Now I know what you’re thinking. Oh no!  Thor’s in a cage.  How did this happen? Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It’s a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn’t find any. That’s when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.",MALE
THOR,How much longer do you think we’ll be here?,MALE
SURTUR,"Thor, Son of Odin.",MALE
THOR,"Surtur.  Son of a bitch...you’re still alive!  I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago. ",MALE
SURTUR,I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.,MALE
THOR,"You know, it’s funny you should mention that because I’ve been having these terrible dreams of late.  Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them. ",MALE
SURTUR,"Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy-- ",MALE
THOR,Hang on.  Hang on.,MALE
THOR,I’ll be back around shortly.  I really feel like we were connecting there.,MALE
THOR,"Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. ",MALE
SURTUR,"My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard’s-- ",MALE
THOR,"Oh, hang on.  Give it a second.",MALE
THOR,"I swear I’m not even moving, it’s just doing this on its own.  I’m really sorry. Okay, let me get this straight. You’re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you’ll suddenly grow as big as a house-- ",MALE
SURTUR,A mountain!,MALE
THOR,The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?,MALE
SURTUR,Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.,MALE
THOR,"Okay, so where is it? This crown? ",MALE
SURTUR,"This is my Crown, the source of my power.",MALE
THOR,"Oh, that’s a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow. ",MALE
SURTUR,It’s a crown.,MALE
THOR,"Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.",MALE
SURTUR,"But Ragnarok has already begun. You cannot stop it.  I am Asgard’s doom, and so are you.  All will suffer, all will burn.",MALE
THOR,"That’s intense.  To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.  But it looks like I’m going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard’s vault. ",MALE
SURTUR,You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?,MALE
THOR,Because that’s what heroes do.,MALE
THOR,"Wait, sorry.  I didn’t time that right.  And, now!",MALE
SURTUR,"You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.",MALE
THOR,I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out.,MALE
THOR,"Heimdall. I know it’s been a while, but I could use a fast exit!",MALE
THOR,...Heimdall?,MALE
SKURGE,"Heimdall was an idiot.  This job should have made him rich.  Now, the job ain’t easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it’s all mine for the taking. Behold...my stuff. ",MALE
SKURGE,"I’m particularly fond of these. I pulled ‘em out of a place on Midgard called Texas.  I even named them. Des and Troy.  You see, when you put them together...they destroy.",MALE
THOR,"Heimdall, come on.",MALE
THOR,Stay. I’m running short on--,MALE
THOR,-options.,MALE
THOR,Heimdall?,MALE
ASGARDIAN WOMAN,"Skurge, is that important?",FEMALE
SKURGE,You girls are in for a treat.,MALE
SKURGE,"Girls! Well well, look who decided to pop in.  Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains. ",MALE
THOR,Who are you?,MALE
SKURGE,Don’t you remember?  I’m Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.,MALE
THOR,Right.  Where’s Heimdall?,MALE
SKURGE,"That traitor.  No one knows, he’s a fugitive of the throne. ",MALE
THOR,Traitor?,MALE
SKURGE,"Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial.  Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe.",MALE
THOR,Sure.,MALE
SKURGE,Hold on.  I’m supposed to announce your arrival.,MALE
THOR,What the hell is that?,MALE
LOKI,"Oh, brother.  This is it.  I take my leave. ",MALE
THOR,"You fool, you didn’t listen! ",MALE
LOKI,I’m sorry.,MALE
THOR,Lady Sif!  Get help!,MALE
ACTOR SIF,Somebody help!,FEMALE
LOKI,Sorry for all I’ve done.,MALE
THOR,It’s all right.   Hold on.,MALE
LOKI,I’m sorry I tried to rule Earth.,MALE
THOR,They’d be lucky to have you.,MALE
LOKI,I’m sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.  I just couldn’t help myself.,MALE
THOR,I know.,MALE
LOKI,I’m a trickster.,MALE
THOR,So mischievous.,MALE
LOKI,Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.,MALE
THOR,It was a wonderful joke.,MALE
ODIN,Twas indeed hilarious.,MALE
THOR,You are the savior of Asgard.,MALE
LOKI,Tell my story.,MALE
THOR,I will.,MALE
LOKI,Build a statue for me.,MALE
THOR,We will build a big statue for you.,MALE
LOKI,"With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns. ",MALE
THOR,I will tell Father what you did here today.,MALE
LOKI,I didn’t do it for him.,MALE
THOR,Noooooo!!!,MALE
ODIN,"And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours.  He fought back those disgusting dark elves.  He brought peace to the realm.",MALE
ODIN,"Loki, my boy...‘Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield.",MALE
ODIN,"On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard’s savior.  No.  You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool’s heart.",MALE
ODIN,Bravo!  Bravo!  Well done.  Bravo.,MALE
THOR,Father.,MALE
ODIN,"Oh, shit.  My son!  Thor has returned! Greetings my boy.",MALE
THOR,It’s an interesting play.  What’s it called?,MALE
ODIN,The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.,MALE
THOR,"Indeed they should. I like that statue.  A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.  A little less weasely.  Less greasy maybe.",MALE
THOR,You know what this is?,MALE
ODIN,The skull of Surtur?  That’s a formidable weapon.,MALE
THOR,Do me a favor.  Lock this in a vault so it doesn’t turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.,MALE
ODIN,"So it’s back to Midgard for you, is it?",MALE
THOR,Nope.  I’ve been having this reocurring dream lately. Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins...,MALE
ODIN,That’s just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination.,MALE
THOR,"Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate.  And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.  Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes. ",MALE
ODIN,"Well, it is best to respect our neighbors’ freedom. ",MALE
THOR,"Of course, the freedom to be massacred. ",MALE
ODIN,"Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself. ",MALE
THOR,Watching theatre.,MALE
ODIN,"Board meetings, and security council meetings... ",MALE
THOR,You really going to make me do it?,MALE
ODIN,Do what?,MALE
THOR,You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.,MALE
THOR,Not even your face.,MALE
ODIN,You’ve gone quite mad.  You’ll be executed for this!,MALE
THOR,Then I’ll see you on the other side...brother.,MALE
LOKI,"Alright, I yield!",MALE
SKURGE,Behold!  Thor..Odinson.,MALE
LOKI,You had one job!  Just the one.,MALE
THOR,Where’s Odin?,MALE
LOKI,"You just couldn’t stay away, could you?  Everything was fine without you.  Asgard was prospering.  You’ve ruined everything.  Ask them.",MALE
THOR,Where’s father?  Did you kill him?,MALE
LOKI,"You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!",MALE
LOKI,Ow-ow-ow!  Alright!  I know exactly where he is.,MALE
LOKI,"I swear, I left him right here. ",MALE
THOR,"Right here on the sidewalk?  Or right there, where the building that’s being demolished?  Great planning. ",MALE
LOKI,How was I supposed to know? Can’t see into the future.  I’m not a witch.,MALE
THOR,Then why do you dress like one?,MALE
LOKI,Hey.,MALE
THOR,"I can’t believe you’re alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you. ",MALE
LOKI,I’m honored.,MALE
COLLEGE GIRL 2,Ask him.,FEMALE
COLLEGE GIRL 1,Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?,FEMALE
THOR,Sure. Start figuring out where he is.,MALE
COLLEGE GIRL 1,"Oh, my god. ",FEMALE
COLLEGE GIRL 2,Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.,FEMALE
THOR,"She didn’t dump me, you know.  I dumped her.  It was a mutual dumping.",MALE
THOR,"What’s this, what are you doing!?",MALE
LOKI,This... isn’t me.,MALE
THOR,Loki?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Thor Odinson.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,God of Thunder.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,You can put down the umbrella.,MALE
THOR,So earth has wizards now?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,The preferred term is “Master of the Mystic Arts.”,MALE
THOR,"Alright wizard, who are you?  Why should I care? ",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you. Take a seat.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Tea?,MALE
THOR,I don’t drink tea.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,What do you drink?,MALE
THOR,Not tea.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world.  Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings.,MALE
THOR,He’s a worthy inclusion.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Then why bring him here?,MALE
THOR,We’re looking for my father.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"So.  If I were to tell you where Odin was, all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard? ",MALE
THOR,Promptly.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Great.  Then I’ll help you.,MALE
THOR,"If you knew where he was, why didn’t you call me? ",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.  Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile. And you don’t have a phone. ",MALE
THOR,"No, I don’t have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter.  It’s called an email. ",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Yeah, do you have a computer? ",MALE
THOR,"No. What for? Anyway, my father is no longer in exile. So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home. ",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Gladly.  He’s in Norway.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I’m just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Nope.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Oh, we don’t need that.",MALE
THOR,Will you stop doing that?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I need just one strand of your hair.,MALE
THOR,"Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-!",MALE
THOR,We could have just walked.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,He’s waiting for you.,MALE
THOR,All right.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Don’t forget your umbrella.,MALE
THOR,Yes.,MALE
THOR,Sorry,MALE
THOR,I suppose I’ll need my brother back.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Yeah, right.",MALE
LOKI,...I have been falling...for thirty minutes!,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,You can handle him from here.,MALE
THOR,Yeah of course. Thank you very much for your help.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Good luck.,MALE
LOKI,Handle me?  Who are you?,MALE
THOR,Loki.,MALE
LOKI,"..you think you’re some kind of sorcerer? Don’t think for one minute, you second-rate... ",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Bye-bye.,MALE
THOR,Father?,MALE
ODIN,Look at this place. It’s beautiful.,MALE
THOR,"Father, it’s us. ",MALE
ODIN,My sons.  I’ve been waiting for you.,MALE
THOR,I know.  We’ve come to take you home.,MALE
ODIN,"Home, yes.  Your mother, she calls me.  Do you hear it?",MALE
THOR,"Loki, lift your magic.",MALE
ODIN,Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.  Frigga would have been proud.,MALE
ODIN,Come and sit with me.  I don’t have much time.,MALE
THOR,"I know that we failed you, but we can make this right. ",MALE
ODIN,I failed you. It is upon us...Ragnarok.,MALE
THOR,"No, I’ve stopped Ragnarok.  I put an end to Surtur. ",MALE
ODIN,"No.  It has already begun.  She’s coming.  My life was all that held her back, but my time has come.  I cannot keep her away any longer. ",MALE
THOR,"Father, who are you talking about? ",MALE
ODIN,The Goddess of Death.  Hela.  My first born. Your sister.,MALE
THOR,...what?,MALE
ODIN,"Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.  I couldn’t stop her, so I imprisoned her.  Locked her away.  She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless. ",MALE
THOR,"Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together. ",MALE
ODIN,No we won’t.  I’m on a different path now.  This you must face alone.,MALE
ODIN,I love you my sons.,MALE
ODIN,Look at that.,MALE
ODIN,Remember this place.  Home.,MALE
LOKI,Brother.,MALE
THOR,This was your doing.,MALE
HELA,So he’s gone? That’s a shame.  I would’ve liked to have seen that.,FEMALE
THOR,"You must be Hela.  I’m Thor, son of Odin. ",MALE
HELA,"Really, you don’t look like him. ",FEMALE
LOKI,Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.,MALE
HELA,You sound like him.,FEMALE
HELA,Kneel.,FEMALE
LOKI,Beg your pardon?,MALE
HELA,Kneel...before your Queen.,FEMALE
THOR,I don’t think so.,MALE
THOR,It’s not possible.,MALE
HELA,"Darling, you have no idea what’s possible.",FEMALE
LOKI,Bring us back!,MALE
THOR,No!!,MALE
THOR,Loki!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Who are you!?  What have you done with Thor?,MALE
HELA,I’m Hela.,FEMALE
SKURGE,I’m just a janitor.,MALE
HELA,You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.  How would you like a job?,FEMALE
LEAD SCRAPPER,Are you a fighter or are you food?,MALE
THOR,I’m just passing through.,MALE
LEAD SCRAPPER,It is food.  On your knees.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,He’s MINE.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,Wait!,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,"Wait!  He’s mine.  So if you want him, you go through me.",MALE
SCRAPPER,But we’ve already got him.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,Alright then I guess I go through you.,MALE
LEAD SCRAPPER,More food.,MALE
THOR,Thank you.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.  I’ve got something special.,MALE
THOR,Hey!  Where are you taking me?,MALE
THOR,"Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin.  I need to get back to Asgard. ",MALE
SCRAPPER #142,"Many apologies, your majesty.",MALE
HELA,It’s come to my attention that you don’t know who I am.,FEMALE
HELA,"I am Hela, Odin’s first born, Commander of the legions of Asgard, the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death. My father is dead.  As are the princes.  You’re welcome. We were once the seat of absolute power in the Cosmos.  Our supremacy was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.  Our destiny is to rule over all others.  And I am here to restore that power.  Kneel before me...and rise into the ranks of my great conquest. ",FEMALE
HOGUN,"Whoever you are... whatever you’ve done, surrender now!  Or we will show you know mercy. ",MALE
HELA,Whoever I am?  Did you listen to a word I said?,FEMALE
HOGUN,This is your last warning!,MALE
HELA,I thought you’d be happy to see me.,FEMALE
HELA,Fine.,FEMALE
HELA,"Oh, I’ve missed this.  Still, it’s a shame.  Good soldiers dying for nothing...all because they couldn’t see the future.  Sad. Oh!  Look, still alive.",FEMALE
HELA,Change of heart?,FEMALE
HOGUN,Go back to whatever cave you crept out of you evil demoness!,MALE
HELA,Let’s go see my palace.,FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,"Fear not, for you are found.  You are home, and there is no going back.  No one leaves this place.",FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,But what is this place?  The answer in Sakaar.,FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,"Surrounded by cosmic gateways, Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown. ",FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,"It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.  Like you. But here on Sakaar, you are significant.  You are valuable. Here, you are loved. ",FEMALE
THOR,What...the hell?,MALE
SOOTHING VOICE,And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.,FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,"He is the original.  The first lost, and the first found.  The creator of Sakaar and the father of the Contest of Champions.",FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,"Where once you were nothing, now you are something.  You are the property of the Grandmaster. Congratulations!  You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.",FEMALE
SOOTHING VOICE,Prepare yourself.  Prepare yourself.  You are now meeting the Grandmaster.,FEMALE
GRANDMASTER,He’s wonderful. It is a he?,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,It’s a he.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? “She is the...” and it starts with a B. ",MALE
TOPAZ,Trash.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"No, not trash.  Were you waiting just to call her that?  It doesn’t start with a “B.” ",MALE
TOPAZ,Booze hag.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"I’m so sorry.  No, “best.”  I was thinking about “best.” Because I always say you’re the best.  She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know. ",MALE
TOPAZ,You say that every time she’s here.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,What have you brought today?  Tell me.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,A contender.,MALE
THOR,A what?,MALE
GRANDMASTER,I need to go closer.  I want a closer look at this.  Can you take us closer?  Thank you.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Pay this lady.,MALE
THOR,Just wait a damn minute.  I’m not for sale.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Man.  He is a fighter.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,I’d take 10 million.,MALE
TOPAZ,Tell her she’s dreaming.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"For heaven’s sake, transfer the units.",MALE
THOR,You’ll pay for this!,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,"No, I got paid for this.",MALE
GRANDMASTER,Here’s what I wanna know.  Who are you?,MALE
THOR,I am the God of THUNDER!!!,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Wow.  I didn’t hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles? ",MALE
TOPAZ,We located your cousin.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Oh good! Yeah, come on. I think you’re gonna like this.",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"There he is.  Hey, cuz.  We almost couldn’t find you.  What, have you been hiding?",MALE
THOR,Hi.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,So...,MALE
COUSIN CARLO,Please.  I’m sorry.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Carlo... I pardon you.,MALE
COUSIN CARLO,Thank you.  Thank you.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,You’re officially pardoned...from life.,MALE
THOR,"Oh, my god!",MALE
GRANDMASTER,I’m stepping in it.  I’m stepping in it.  Look out!,MALE
THOR,"Oh, the smell. ",MALE
GRANDMASTER,What does it smell like?,MALE
TOPAZ,Burnt toast.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,What happened to my manners?  I haven’t properly introduced myself. Come on.  Follow me.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"My name is Grandmaster.  I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.  People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.  And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.  What do you say to that? ",MALE
THOR,"We’re not friends, and I don’t give a shit about your games! I’m going back to Asgard! ",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Ass-gard? One, two, three, four.",MALE
LOKI,"There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.  At that moment, I let go. ",MALE
THOR,Loki!? Loki! Over here!,MALE
LOKI,Excuse me one second.,MALE
THOR,Loki!,MALE
LOKI,What?  You’re alive?,MALE
THOR,"Yes, of course I’m alive. ",MALE
LOKI,What are you doing here?,MALE
THOR,"What do you mean, what am I doing? I’m stuck in this stupid chair. Where’s your chair? ",MALE
LOKI,I didn’t get a chair.,MALE
THOR,Get me out of this one.,MALE
LOKI,I can’t.,MALE
THOR,What?,MALE
LOKI,I’ve made friends with this man. He’s called the Grandmaster.,MALE
THOR,"Oh, he’s crazy! ",MALE
LOKI,I’ve gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.,MALE
THOR,Weeks ago?  I just got here.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,What are you whispering about?,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Time works real different around these parts. On any other world, I’d be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar...",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder? ",MALE
THOR,God of Thunder.  Tell him.,MALE
LOKI,I’ve never met this man in my life.,MALE
THOR,He’s my brother.,MALE
LOKI,Adopted.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Is he any kind of a fighter?,MALE
THOR,You take this thing out of my neck and I’ll show you.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Now listen to that.  He’s threatening me.  Hey, Sparkles, here’s the deal.  If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg... ",MALE
THOR,Asgard.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win. ",MALE
THOR,Fine.  Then point me in the direction of whoever’s ass I have to kick.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"That’s what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord. ",MALE
THOR,Loki!,MALE
KORG,"Hey!  Take it easy man! Over here.  The pile of rocks waving at you.  Yeah I’m actually a thing, I’m a being.  Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I’m kind of like the leader in here.  I’m made of rocks, as you can see, but don’t let that intimidate you.  You don’t need to be afraid unless you’re made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.  This is my very good friend over here, Miek.  He’s an insect and has knives for hands.",MALE
THOR,"You’re a Kronan, aren’t you? ",MALE
KORG,That I am.,MALE
THOR,How’d you end up in here?,MALE
KORG,"Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn’t print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. Except for my mom and her boyfriend, who I hate.  As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.  Bit of a promotional disaster. But I’m actually organizing another revolution.  I don’t know if you’d be interested in something like that.  Do you reckon you’d be interested?",MALE
THOR,How did you...,MALE
KORG,"Yeah, no.  This whole thing is a circle.  But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle. ",MALE
THOR,This doesn’t make any sense.,MALE
KORG,"No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense. ",MALE
THOR,Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster’s Champion?,MALE
KORG,"Doug has. Doug! Oh, right, Doug’s dead. That’s right.  Everyone who fights the Grandmaster’s champion perishes. ",MALE
THOR,What about you? You’re made of rocks.,MALE
KORG,"Perishable rocks. There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot.  Wait. You’re not gonna face him, are you? ",MALE
THOR,"Yes I am.  Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place. ",MALE
KORG,"That’s exactly what Doug used to say.  See you later, new Doug.",MALE
HELA,Does no one remember me?  Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies.  Goblets and garden parties?  Peace treaties?,FEMALE
HELA,Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it.,FEMALE
HELA,"We were unstoppable. I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard’s empire. One by one, the realms became ours.",FEMALE
HELA,"But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.  Before that, Asgard’s warriors were honored, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very place.",FEMALE
SKURGE,Odin’s treasures.,MALE
HELA,Fake.,FEMALE
HELA,Most of the stuff in here is fake.,FEMALE
HELA,Or weak.,FEMALE
HELA,Smaller than I thought it would be.,FEMALE
HELA,That’s not bad? But this... The Eternal Flame.,FEMALE
HELA,Want to see what true power looks like?,FEMALE
HELA,"Fenris.  My darling, what have they done to you?",FEMALE
HELA,"With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn!",FEMALE
HELA,I’ve missed you.  I’ve missed you all.,FEMALE
THOR,"Odin, I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla... Where the brave shall live forever. Nor shall we mourn but rejoice- ",MALE
THOR,-for those that have died the glorious death.,MALE
LOKI,-for those that have died the glorious death.,MALE
LOKI,"It hurts, doesn’t it? Being lied to. Being told you’re one thing and then learning it’s all a fiction.",MALE
LOKI,"You didn’t think I’d really come and see you, did you?  This place is disgusting.",MALE
LOKI,Does this mean you don’t want my help?,MALE
LOKI,"Look, I couldn’t jeopardize my position with Grandmaster, it took me time to win his trust. He’s a lunatic, but he can be amenable.",MALE
LOKI,"What I’m telling you is, you could join me at the Grandmaster’s side. Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then... ",MALE
LOKI,"You’re not seriously thinking of going back, are you? Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.  She’s stronger than both of us.  She’s stronger than you. You don’t stand a chance. Do you understand what I’m saying to you?",MALE
LOKI,Fine.  I guess I’ll just have to go it alone.  Like I’ve always done.  Would you say something?,MALE
LOKI,Say something!,MALE
THOR,"What would you like me to say?  You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death. Have I said enough, or do you do you want me to go further back than the past two days?",MALE
LOKI,"You know, I haven’t seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I’ve heard he’s astonishingly savage.  I’ve placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don’t let me down.",MALE
KORG,"Piss off, ghost! He’s freaking gone.",MALE
KORG,"Yuck!  There’s Still someone’s hair and blood all over this.  Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?  Disgusting slobs. Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork? ",MALE
THOR,No.,MALE
KORG,"Yeah, not really useful unless you’re fighting off three vampires that were huddled together. ",MALE
THOR,I really wish I had my hammer.,MALE
KORG,Hammer?,MALE
THOR,"Quite unique.  It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.  And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly. ",MALE
KORG,You rode a hammer?,MALE
THOR,"No, I didn’t ride the hammer. ",MALE
KORG,The hammer rode you on your back?,MALE
THOR,"No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the... ",MALE
KORG,Oh my God.  The hammer pulled you off?,MALE
THOR,"The ground.  It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly.  Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me. ",MALE
KORG,Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.,MALE
THOR,That’s a nice way of putting it.,MALE
SCRAPPER #142,I said they’re mine.,MALE
THOR,"See her, the one that put me in here. ",MALE
KORG,"Yeah, Scrapper 142.  She’s strong. And she drinks a lot. Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.  They are hard to perish. ",MALE
THOR,Asgardian?,MALE
THOR,Hey!  Hey!,MALE
THOR,Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.  Asgard is in danger.,MALE
THOR,"My God, you’re a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women.  There’s nothing wrong with women, of course.  I love women.  Sometimes a little too much.  Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.  I think it’s great that there is an elite force of women warriors.  It’s about time. ",MALE

SKURGE,I just want a chance to prove myself.,MALE
HELA,"Recognition. When I was young every great King had an executioner.  Not just to execute people, but also to execute their vision.  But mainly to execute people.  Still a great honor. I was Odin’s executioner.",FEMALE

HEIMDALL,Come see for yourself.,MALE
HEIMDALL,I’m providing refuge in a stronghold build by our ancestors. But if the garrison falls our only escape will is Bi-Frost.,MALE
THOR,You’re talking about evacuating Asgard?,MALE
HEIMDALL,We won’t last long if we stay.,MALE

BRUCE BANNER,It’s okay.,MALE
THOR,You just can’t go around throwing shields at people.  Could have killed me.,MALE

THOR,"I know. We’re the same, you and I. We’re just a couple of hot-headed fools. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water. ",MALE

VALKYRIE,I’m not getting dragged into another one of Odin’s family squabbles.,FEMALE
THOR,What’s that supposed to mean?,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Your sister.  Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.",FEMALE
VALKYRIE,"When it grew beyond Odin’s control, she massacred everyone in the palace and tried to seize the throne.  When she tried to escape her banishment, he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back. I only survived because... Look, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne, and it cost me everything.  THAT’S what’s wrong with Asgard.  The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.",FEMALE
THOR,I agree.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Don’t get familiar.,FEMALE
THOR,"I agree.  That’s why I turned down the throne.  But this isn’t about the crown.  This is about the people.  They’re dying and they’re you’re people, too.",MALE
VALKYRIE,Forget it.  I have.,FEMALE

BRUCE BANNER,Who’s that?,MALE
THOR,He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I did?,MALE
THOR,Yeah. Quite a lot’s happened. You and I had a fight recently.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Did I win?,MALE
THOR,"No, I won. Easily. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Doesn’t sound right.,MALE
THOR,"Well, it’s true. ",MALE
GRANDMASTER,It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.,MALE
THOR,Seductive GOD of Thunder.  We need to move.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, no.  This is bad.  This is really, really bad.  Thor, I think I’m freaking out. ",MALE

THOR,"No, he’s not here.  But listen. Just stay calm, okay?  The sun’s going down.  The sun’s getting really low.  Sun’s going down.",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"I’m upset!  I’m very upset.  You know what I like about being upset? Blame.  Right now, that’s the mindset that I’m in.  And you know who I’m blaming? ",MALE
LOKI,"Grandmaster, I- ",MALE
GRANDMASTER,Hey! Don’t interrupt me!,MALE
TOPAZ,Here you go.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Why are you handing me the melt stick?  He was interrupting. That’s not a capital violation.  My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder.  It’s all because of him. YOUR brother.  Whatever the story is.  Adopted, or complicated.  I’m sure there’s a big history. And YOUR contender. ",MALE
LOKI,"My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,I can do it in two.,FEMALE
LOKI,I could do it in one.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"You know what?  I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution.  But for now, I’ll settle for this sweet little “who’s gonna get him first?”  So you’re on the clock. Valkyrie exits in a hurry.  Loki follows her. ",MALE
LOKI,What have you done!?,MALE
VALKYRIE,"I don’t answer to you, lackey. ",FEMALE
LOKI,It’s Loki.  And you will answer to the Grandmaster.,MALE
LOKI,Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?,MALE
VALKYRIE,I don’t help anyone.,FEMALE
LOKI,You’re a Valkyrie.  I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?,MALE
VALKYRIE,Choose your next words wisely.,FEMALE
LOKI,Terribly sorry.  Must be a very painful memory...,MALE
THOR,The sun’s going down. It’s getting really low.  The sun’s going down. It’s getting real low.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Would you stop saying that!?,MALE
THOR,I just need you to stay calm.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Calm!?  I’m on an alien planet!,MALE
THOR,It’s just a planet.  You’ve been on a planet before.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Yeah!  One!,MALE
THOR,Now you’ve been on two. That’s a good thing.  It’s a new experience.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"My neurons, they’re firing faster than my brain can handle the information. The whole thing is totally different this time. In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it’s like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk. ",MALE
THOR,"Alright, well, you’re back now, that’s all that matters. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, it’s not what matters.  What I’m trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back.  And we’re stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out. ",MALE
THOR,"We’re not stranded, I’m gonna figure out a way to get us home. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Thank you.,MALE
THOR,"Not your home, though.  Asgard. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,What?,MALE
THOR,"Listen, my people are in great danger.  You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don’t wanna fight your sister.  That’s a family issue. ",MALE
THOR,"No, she’s an evil being. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don’t care what she is.  I’m not fighting any more beings.  I’m sick of it.  I just told you.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"If I turn into the BRUCE BANNER, I am never gonna come back again. And you don’t care. ",MALE
THOR,"No, no.  I’m putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, you’re just using me to get to the Hulk. ",MALE
THOR,What?  No!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,It’s gross.  You don’t care about me.  You’re not my friend.,MALE
THOR,"No!  I don’t even like the Hulk. He’s all like... “smash, smash, smash.”  I prefer you. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Thanks.,MALE
THOR,"But if I’m being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, Banner’s powerful and useful, too. ",MALE
THOR,Is he though?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.  How many PhDs does Banner have?  Seven.,MALE
THOR,"Fine, you don’t have to fight anyone.  But we’re in danger here, so we have to move.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,What are you doing with that?,MALE
THOR,I need a disguise.  I’m a fugitive.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I need a disguise.,MALE
THOR,You are the disguise.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I’ll be Tony Stark.,MALE
THOR,What?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Yeah.  Tony and the gypsy.,MALE
THOR,"No, no you’re not Tony.  You’re Bruce Banner. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Then why did you dress me up like Tony?,MALE
THOR,Because you were naked.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, I’ll give you that.",MALE
THOR,What are you doing?  Stop doing that!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Tony wears his pants super tight!,MALE
THOR,Why are you being so weird?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don’t know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird.,MALE
THOR,"Hey.  It’s okay.  You’re good. Calm down.  Come on.  Listen, we’re gonna go to Asgard and you’re not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,All right.,MALE
THOR,This is bad.  Banner!  Banner!,MALE
THOR,Hi.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Hi.,FEMALE
THOR,I was gonna do that.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Yeah, well, I did it first. ",FEMALE
THOR,That’s good.  What are you doing here?,MALE
VALKYRIE,What are you doing here?  I thought you were leaving.,FEMALE
THOR,I got sidetracked.,MALE
VALKYRIE,What’s with the...,FEMALE
THOR,It’s my disguise.,MALE
VALKYRIE,But I can see your face.,FEMALE
THOR,"Not when I do this, you can’t. Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she’s killed? She’s so beautiful and strong...,MALE
VALKYRIE,Who is this guy?,FEMALE
THOR,He’s a friend.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Who?  Me?  I’m Bruce.,MALE
VALKYRIE,I feel like I know you.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,I feel like I know you too.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Look, I’ve spent years in a haze trying to forget my past.  Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day. ",FEMALE
THOR,"I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,"I don’t plan to stop drinking, but I don’t want to forget.  I can’t turn away anymore.  So, if I’m donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag. ",FEMALE
THOR,Good.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Yeah.  So I’m saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?,FEMALE
THOR,"Yeah, it’s called the Revengers. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,Revengers?,FEMALE
THOR,Because I’m getting revenge. You’re getting revenge. Do you want revenge?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I’m undecided.,MALE
THOR,Okay.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Also, I’ve got a peace offering.",FEMALE
LOKI,Surprise.,MALE
LOKI,OW!,MALE
THOR,Just had to be sure.,MALE
LOKI,"Hello, Bruce. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.  Where are you at these days? ",MALE
LOKI,It varies from moment to moment.,MALE
THOR,Is that... a Dragonfang?,MALE
VALKYRIE,It is.,FEMALE
THOR,My God.  This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits. A nice clean wormhole outside the city.,FEMALE
VALKYRIE,Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months.,FEMALE
THOR,Nope. We’re going through that one.,MALE
VALKYRIE,The Devil’s Anus?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, whose anus are we going through? ",MALE
THOR,"For the record, I didn’t know it was called that when I picked it. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge.,MALE
VALKYRIE,We need another ship.  That would tear mine to pieces.,FEMALE
THOR,She’s right.  We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"And we need one with cup holders, because we’re gonna die.  So, drinks! ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Do I know you?  I feel like I know you.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"I feel like I know you, too. It’s weird. ",FEMALE
THOR,"What do you say, doctor?  Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,We need a ship.,MALE
THOR,Need a ship.,MALE
VALKYRIE,"There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models-- ",FEMALE
LOKI,"I don’t mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.",MALE
VALKYRIE,And suddenly you’re overcome with an urge to do the right thing.,FEMALE
LOKI,"Heavens, no. I’ve run out of favor with the Grandmaster. And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I’m asking for safe passage...through the anus. ",MALE
THOR,You’re telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?,MALE
LOKI,"Yes, brother. I can. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,He did try to kill me.,FEMALE
THOR,"Yes, me too.  On many, many occasions.  There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes.  So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, “Yeah, it’s me!” And he stabbed me.  We were eight at the time.",MALE
VALKYRIE,"If we’re boosting a ship, we’re gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace. ",FEMALE
LOKI,Why not set the beast loose?,MALE
THOR,Shut up.,MALE
VALKYRIE,You guys have a beast?,FEMALE
THOR,"No, there’s no beast. He’s just being stupid.  We’re going to start a revolution. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Revolution?,MALE
THOR,I’ll explain later.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Who’s this guy again?,FEMALE
THOR,I’ll explain later.,MALE
KORG,"Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that’s coming out of you?  Or are they eggs?  Looks like eggs.",MALE
VALKYRIE,I’m looking for Korg.,FEMALE
KORG,"Who’s asking?  I know you’re asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?",MALE
VALKYRIE,The Lord of Thunder sends his best.,FEMALE
KORG,My revolution has begun...,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Revolution?  How did this happen?,MALE
TOPAZ,Don’t know.  But the Arena’s mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.,MALE
GRANDMASTER,Oh! I don’t like that word!,MALE
TOPAZ,Mainframe?,MALE
GRANDMASTER,"No.  Why would I not like “mainframe?”  No, the “S” word. ",MALE
TOPAZ,"Sorry, the “prisoners with jobs” have armed themselves. ",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Okay, that’s better.",MALE
THOR,"Hey, so listen, we should talk. ",MALE
LOKI,I disagree.  Open communication was never our family’s forte.,MALE
THOR,You have no idea.  I’ve had quite the revelation since we spoke last.,MALE
THOR,Hello!,MALE
LOKI,Hi!,MALE
LOKI,"Odin brought us together, it’s almost poetic that his death should split us apart.  We might as well be strangers now.  “Two sons of the crown” set adrift.",MALE
THOR,Thought you didn’t want to talk about it?,MALE
LOKI,Here’s the thing. I’m probably better off staying here on Sakaar.,MALE
THOR,That’s exactly what I was thinking.,MALE
LOKI,...Did you just agree with me?,MALE
THOR,"This place is perfect for you. It’s savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you’re going to do GREAT here. ",MALE
LOKI,Do you truly think so little of me?,MALE
THOR,"Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you’re you, I’m me... I don’t know, maybe there’s still good in you, but let’s be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.",MALE
LOKI,It’s probably for the best that we never see one another again.,MALE
THOR,That’s what you always wanted.,MALE
THOR,"Hey, let’s do “Get Help.” ",MALE
LOKI,What?,MALE
THOR,“Get Help.”,MALE
LOKI,No.,MALE
THOR,"Come on, you love it. ",MALE
LOKI,I hate it.,MALE
THOR,It’s great. IT works every time.,MALE
LOKI,It’s humiliating.,MALE
THOR,Do you have a better plan?,MALE
LOKI,No.,MALE
THOR,We’re doing it.,MALE
LOKI,We are not doing “Get Help.”,MALE
THOR,"Get help! Please! My brother, he’s dying.",MALE
THOR,Get help! Help him!,MALE
THOR,Classic.,MALE
LOKI,I still hate it. It’s humiliating.,MALE
THOR,"Not for me, it’s not. ",MALE
THOR,Which one’s the ship she told us to get?,MALE
LOKI,The Commodore.,MALE
LOKI,Though I feel it won’t make much of a difference...,MALE
THOR,"Oh, Loki.",MALE
LOKI,"I know I’ve betrayed you many times before, but this time it’s truly nothing personal.  The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.",MALE
THOR,"Never one for sentiment, were you? ",MALE
LOKI,Easier to let it burn.,MALE
THOR,I agree.,MALE
THOR,"Oh brother, you’re becoming predictable.  I trust you, you betray me.  Round and round in circles we go.",MALE
THOR,"See, Loki, life is about, it’s about growth.  It’s about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I’m trying to say is that you’ll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more.  I’ll just put this over here for you.",MALE
THOR,"Anyway, I got places to be so good luck.",MALE
THOR,"All right, I can figure this out. It’s just another spaceship.",MALE
GRANDMASTER,"Loyal Sakaarians, Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.  Sakaarians, take to the skies.  Bring him down.  Do not let him leave this planet.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Good shot!,MALE
VALKYRIE,Open the doors.,FEMALE
VALKYRIE,I hope that you’re tougher than you look.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Why?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Shouldn’t we be shooting back or something?,MALE
THOR,"Yes, we should. Where are the guns on this ship? ",MALE
VALKYRIE,There aren’t any.  It’s a leisure vessel.,FEMALE
THOR / BRUCE BANNER,WHAT?!,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?,MALE
THOR,Yeah. Don’t touch anything.,MALE
THOR,No!,MALE
THOR,Get inside!,MALE
VALKYRIE,In a minute!,FEMALE
THOR,I should probably go and help.,MALE
THOR,"Here, take the wheel. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,No. I don’t know how to fly one of these.,MALE
THOR,You’re a scientist.  Use one of your PhDs.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,None of them are for flying alien spaceships!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, come on.  There’s gotta be a gun on this thing.  That looks like a gun.",MALE
GRANDMASTER,It’s MY BIRTHDAY! It’s MY BIRTHDAY! It’s MY BIRTHDAY.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Yeah!,MALE
VALKYRIE,"Guys, we’re coming up on the Devil’s Anus!",FEMALE
KORG,"There she is.  Our ticket out of here.  Hey, what’s this?",MALE
LOKI,Thank you.,MALE
KORG,"Hey man, we’re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.  You wanna come? ",MALE
LOKI,You do seem like you’re in desperate need of leadership.,MALE
KORG,Why thank you.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Here we go!,FEMALE
SKURGE,"Asgardians, some misguided soul has stolen the Bifrost sword.  Tell us where it is, or there will be consequences.  Bad ones.",MALE
SKURGE,Well?,MALE
HELA,You.,FEMALE
ASGARDIAN CITIZENS,No! Stop!,NEUTRAL
HELA,Well?  Executioner?,FEMALE
ASGARDIAN MAN,Wait! I know where the sword is.,MALE
VALKYRIE,I never thought I’d be back here.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I thought it’d be nicer.  I mean, not that it’s not nice.  It’s just, it’s on fire. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,"Here, up here in the mountains.",FEMALE
VALKYRIE,Heat signatures.  People clustered together.  Hela’s coming for them.,FEMALE
THOR,"Okay, drop me off at the palace and I’ll draw her away. ",MALE
VALKYRIE,And get yourself killed?,FEMALE
THOR,"The people trapped down there are all that matters.  While I’m dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,How the hell are we supposed to do that?,MALE
THOR,I have a man on the ground.,MALE
HEIMDALL,Asgard. She’s here.,MALE
THOR,Now the ship has guns.,MALE
VALKYRIE,I’ll take it from here.,FEMALE
THOR,I found this in the armory.,MALE
VALKYRIE,“Your majesty.”  Don’t die.  You know what I mean.,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,We must keep moving! Go to the Bifrost!,MALE
THOR,Sister.,MALE
HELA,You’re still alive.,FEMALE
THOR,"I love what you’ve done with the place.  Redecorating, I see. ",MALE
HELA,It seems our father’s solution to every problem was to cover it up.,FEMALE
THOR,Or to cast it out. He told you you were worthy.  He said the same thing to me.,MALE
HELA,"You see, you never knew him, not at his best. Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears. Where do you think all this gold came from? And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king. To foster peace, to protect life. To have you. ",FEMALE
THOR,"I understand why you’re angry. And you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne. And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule. But it can’t be you.  You’re just...the worst.",MALE
HELA,"Okay, get up.  You’re in my seat. ",FEMALE
THOR,"You know, Father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war. ",MALE
HELA,But must always be ready for it.,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,Go back!,MALE
HELA,"To be honest, I expected more.",FEMALE
SKURGE,Heimdall!  The sword!,MALE
HEIMDALL,We must cross now!  To Bi-Frost!,MALE
HELA,"Here’s the difference between us. I’m Odin’s firstborn, the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard. And you’re nothing. ",FEMALE
HELA,So simple.  Even a blind man could see it.,FEMALE
HELA,Now you remind me of Dad.,FEMALE
VALKYRIE,This stupid dog won’t die!,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Everything’s going to be okay.  I got this.  You want to know who I am?,MALE
VALKYRIE,What the hell are you talking about?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,You’ll see.,MALE
HELA,You see?  No one’s going anywhere. I’ll get that sword even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.,FEMALE
KORG,Hey man.  I’m Korg.  This is Miek.,MALE
KORG,We’re going to jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Want to come?,MALE
LOKI,Your savior is here!,MALE
HELA,That little shit.,FEMALE
LOKI,"Did you miss me?  Everybody on that ship, now.",MALE
HEIMDALL,Welcome home.  I saw you coming.,MALE
LOKI,Of course you did.,MALE
HELA,"A valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.",FEMALE
HELA,"You see?  I’m not a queen, or a monster. ",FEMALE
HELA,I’m the Goddess of Death.,FEMALE
HELA,What were you the God of again?,FEMALE
ODIN,Even when you had two eyes you were only seeing half the picture.,MALE
THOR,She’s too strong.  Without my hammer I cannot--,MALE
ODIN,"Are you Thor, God of Hammers?",MALE
ODIN,"That hammer helped you control your power, focus it.  But it was never the source of your strength.",MALE
THOR,It’s too late. She’s already taken Asgard.,MALE
ODIN,Asgard is not a place. Never has been. This could be Asgard.  It is wherever our people stand.  And right now those people need you.,MALE
THOR,I’m not as strong as you.,MALE
ODIN,No.  You’re stronger. ,MALE
HELA,"Tell me brother, what were you the God of again...? ",FEMALE
THOR,You’re late.,MALE
LOKI,You’re missing an eye.,MALE
VALKYRIE,This isn’t over.,FEMALE
THOR,I think we should disband the Revengers.,MALE
LOKI,Hit her with a lightning blast.,MALE
THOR,I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.  It did nothing.,MALE
VALKYRIE,We need to hold her off until everybody’s on board.,FEMALE
THOR,It won’t end there.  The longer Hela’s on Asgard the more powerful she grows.  She’ll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.,MALE
VALKYRIE,What’s our move?,FEMALE
LOKI,I’m not doing “Get help.”,MALE
THOR,"Asgard’s not a place, it’s a people. This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. Go to the vault.  Surtur’s crown. It’s the only way. ",MALE
LOKI,"Bold move, brother. Even for me.",MALE
THOR,Shall we?,MALE
VALKYRIE,After you.,FEMALE
LOKI,This is madness.,MALE
THOR,GO!  GO NOW!,MALE
SKURGE,For Asgard.,MALE
SKURGE,HELA!,MALE
LOKI,"With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.",MALE
THOR,HELA!  Enough!,MALE
THOR,You want Asgard?  It’s yours.,MALE
HELA,"Whatever game you’re playing, it won’t work.  You can’t defeat me. ",FEMALE
THOR,"No, but he can.",MALE
HELA,No...NO!,FEMALE
SURTUR,"Tremble before me Asgard, for I am your reckoning!",MALE
VALKYRIE,The people are safe.  That’s all that matters.,FEMALE
THOR,We’re fulfilling the prophecy.,MALE
VALKYRIE,I hate this prophecy.,FEMALE
THOR,"So do I, but we have no choice.",MALE
THOR,"Surtur destroys Asgard, he destroys Hela so that our people can live.",MALE
THOR,We need to let him finish... No!,MALE
THOR,Hulk no!  Stop it you moron!!,MALE
THOR,"BRUCE BANNER, just for once in your life, don’t smash! ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,But...big Monster.,MALE
VALKYRIE,Hulk! Let’s go.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Friends.,MALE
SURTUR,I am Asgard’s doom!!,MALE
KORG,"The damage is not too bad.  As long as the foundations are strong, we can rebuild this place.  It will become a haven for all people and aliens of the universe...",MALE
KORG,"Nope, those foundations are gone. Sorry.",MALE
THOR,What have I done?,MALE
HEIMDALL,"You saved us from extinction. Asgard is not a place, it’s a people.",MALE
LOKI,It suits you.,MALE
THOR,"Perhaps you’re not so bad after all, brother. ",MALE
LOKI,Maybe not.,MALE
THOR,"Thank you, Loki.",MALE
THOR,"And if you were here, I might even give you a hug.",MALE
LOKI,Do we have to hug now?,MALE
VALKYRIE,Your throne.,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,"So, King of Asgard.",MALE
HEIMDALL,Where to?,MALE
THOR,"I’m not sure.  Any suggestions? Miek, what’s your home planet?",MALE
KORG,"Oh, Miek’s dead.  I accidentally stepped on him on the bridge, I’ve just felt so guilty I’ve been carrying him around all day...",MALE
KORG,"Miek, you’re alive!  He’s alive everyone!  What was your question?",MALE
THOR,Earth it is.,MALE
LOKI,Do you really think it’s a good idea to go back to Earth?,MALE
THOR,Sure!  They love me there.,MALE
LOKI,Let me rephrase: Do you really think it’s a good idea to bring me back to Earth?,MALE
THOR,"Probably not.  But don’t worry, brother...I’ve got a feeling that everything’s going to work out.",MALE
