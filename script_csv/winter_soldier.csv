149,NICK FURY,"You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.",MALE
150,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.",MALE
151,NICK FURY,"SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.",MALE

165,PEGGY CARTER,"You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.",FEMALE
166,STEVE ROGERS,You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.,MALE

He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, ""No, we'll negotiate."" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.",MALE
325,STEVE ROGERS,So you gave him a promotion.,MALE
326,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?",MALE
327,STEVE ROGERS,I don't know.,MALE
328,ALEXANDER PIERCE,You know it was bugged?,MALE
329,STEVE ROGERS,"I did, because Nick told me.",MALE
330,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?  I want you to see something.,MALE
331,SHIELD AGENT,"Who hired you, Batroc?",MALE
332,STEVE ROGERS,Is that live?,MALE
333,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.",MALE
334,STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.,MALE
335,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.",MALE
336,STEVE ROGERS,Am I supposed to know who that is?,MALE
337,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.,MALE
338,STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?,MALE
339,ALEXANDER PIERCE,The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.,MALE
340,STEVE ROGERS,If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.,MALE
341,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry.  Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?",MALE
342,STEVE ROGERS,He told me not to trust anyone.,MALE
343,ALEXANDER PIERCE,I wonder if that included him.,MALE
344,STEVE ROGERS,I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me.,MALE
345,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Captain.  Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.",MALE
346,STEVE ROGERS,Understood.,MALE
347,STEVE ROGERS,Operations control.,MALE
348,SHIELD COMPUTER,Confirmed.,FEMALE
349,BROCK RUMLOW,Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.,MALE
350,STRIKE AGENT #1,Understood.,MALE
351,STRIKE AGENT #2,"Yes, sir.",MALE
352,BROCK RUMLOW,Forensics.,MALE
353,SHIELD COMPUTER,Confirmed.,FEMALE
354,BROCK RUMLOW,Cap.,MALE
355,STEVE ROGERS,Rumlow.,MALE
356,BROCK RUMLOW,Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?,MALE
357,STEVE ROGERS,"No, lets wait and see what it is first.",MALE
358,BROCK RUMLOW,Right.,MALE
359,SHIELD AGENT #1,What's the status so far?,FEMALE
360,SHIELD AGENT #2,Administrations level.,FEMALE
361,SHIELD COMPUTER,Confirmed.,FEMALE
362,SHIELD AGENT #2,Excuse me.,FEMALE
363,BROCK RUMLOW,"I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.",MALE
364,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.,MALE
365,STRIKE AGENT #3,Records.,MALE
366,SHIELD COMPUTER,Confirmed.,FEMALE
367,STEVE ROGERS,"Before we get started, does anyone want to get out?",MALE
368,JASPER SITWELL,"Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor.",MALE
369,BROCK RUMLOW,"Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal.",MALE
370,STEVE ROGERS,It kind of feels personal.,MALE
371,25TH FLOOR STRIKE AGENT,Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air!,NEUTRAL
372,STRIKE AGENT,"Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go!",FEMALE
373,JASPER SITWELL,Are you kidding me?  He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge!,MALE
374,QUINJET PILOT,"Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.  Repeat, stand down.",MALE
375,JASPER SITWELL,"Eyes here.  Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.",MALE
376,SHARON CARTER,"With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.",FEMALE
377,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Because he lied to us.  Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.",MALE
378,STEVE ROGERS,Where is it?,MALE
379,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Safe.,FEMALE
380,STEVE ROGERS,Do better!,MALE
381,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where did you get it?,FEMALE
382,STEVE ROGERS,Why would I tell you?,MALE
383,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fury gave it to you. Why?,FEMALE
384,STEVE ROGERS,What's on it?,MALE
385,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don't know.,FEMALE
386,STEVE ROGERS,Stop lying!,MALE
387,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I only act like I know everything, Rogers.",FEMALE
388,STEVE ROGERS,"I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?",MALE
389,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.",FEMALE
390,STEVE ROGERS,I'm not gonna ask you again.,MALE
391,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.",FEMALE
392,STEVE ROGERS,So he's a ghost story.,MALE
393,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me.  Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.",FEMALE
394,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.",MALE
395,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.  Like you said, he's a ghost story.",FEMALE
396,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.",MALE
397,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.",MALE
398,COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.,MALE
399,COUNCILMAN SINGH,"Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...",MALE
400,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.,MALE
401,COUNCILWOMAN HAWLEY,That discussion can be tabled for a later time.,FEMALE
402,ALEXANDER PIERCE,But you do want to have a discussion.,MALE
403,COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,"We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.",MALE
404,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.",FEMALE
405,STEVE ROGERS,"If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.",MALE
406,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.",FEMALE
407,STEVE ROGERS,How much time do we have?,MALE
408,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Uh...about nine minutes from...  Now.  Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.",FEMALE
409,STEVE ROGERS,Can you override it?,MALE
410,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly.   I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.",FEMALE
411,APPLE EMPLOYEE,Can I help you guys with anything?,MALE
412,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.",FEMALE
413,STEVE ROGERS,Right! We're getting married.,MALE
414,APPLE EMPLOYEE,Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going?,MALE
415,STEVE ROGERS,New Jersey.,MALE
416,APPLE EMPLOYEE,Oh.  I have the exact same glasses.,MALE
417,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Wow, you two are practically twins.",FEMALE
418,APPLE EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.",MALE
419,STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you.  You said nine minutes, come on.",MALE
420,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Shh, relax. Got it.  You know it?",FEMALE
421,STEVE ROGERS,"I used to. Let's go.  Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro.",MALE
422,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.",FEMALE
423,STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
424,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do it!,FEMALE
425,JACK ROLLINS,Negative at the source.,MALE
426,BROCK RUMLOW,Give me a floor rundown.,MALE
427,SHIELD AGENT #2,Negative on three.,FEMALE
428,SHIELD AGENT #3,Negative on two.,FEMALE
429,BROCK RUMLOW,"Snake the upper levels, work down to me.",MALE
430,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Kiss me.,FEMALE
431,STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
432,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.,FEMALE
433,STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, they do.",MALE
434,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You still uncomfortable?,FEMALE
435,STEVE ROGERS,It's not exactly the word I would use.,MALE
436,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?,FEMALE
437,STEVE ROGERS,Nazi Germany.,MALE
438,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Mm.,FEMALE
439,STEVE ROGERS,And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash.,MALE
440,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?",FEMALE
441,STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
442,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Was that your first kiss since 1945?,FEMALE
443,STEVE ROGERS,"That bad, huh?",MALE
444,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't say that.,FEMALE
445,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.",MALE
446,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.",FEMALE
447,STEVE ROGERS,You don't need practice.,MALE
448,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everybody needs practice.,FEMALE
449,STEVE ROGERS,"It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.",MALE
450,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Nobody special, though?",FEMALE
451,STEVE ROGERS,"Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.",MALE
452,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, that's alright, you just make something up.",FEMALE
453,STEVE ROGERS,"What, like you?",MALE
454,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.",FEMALE
455,STEVE ROGERS,That's a tough way to live.,MALE
456,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"It's a good way not to die, though.",FEMALE
457,STEVE ROGERS,"You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.",MALE
458,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah. Who do you want me to be?,FEMALE
459,STEVE ROGERS,How about a friend?,MALE
460,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.",FEMALE
461,STEVE ROGERS,This is it.,MALE
462,NATASHA ROMANOFF,The file came from these coordinates.,FEMALE
463,STEVE ROGERS,So did I.  This camp is where I was trained.,MALE
464,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Changed much?,FEMALE
465,STEVE ROGERS,A little.,MALE
466,SERGEANT DUFFY,"Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it!  Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in!",MALE
467,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off.  What is it?",FEMALE
468,STEVE ROGERS,Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place.,MALE
469,NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is SHIELD.,FEMALE
470,STEVE ROGERS,Maybe where it started.,MALE
471,NATASHA ROMANOFF,There's Stark's father.,FEMALE
472,STEVE ROGERS,Howard.,MALE
473,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Who's the girl?,FEMALE
474,STEVE ROGERS,If you're already working in a secret office...  Why do you need to hide the elevator?,MALE
475,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient.",FEMALE
476,COMPUTER,Initiate system?,FEMALE
477,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Y-E-S, spells yes.  ""Shall we play a game?""  It's from a movie that...",FEMALE
478,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I saw it.",MALE
479,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984.",FEMALE
480,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It's some kind of a recording.,FEMALE
481,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am.",FEMALE
482,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do you know this thing?,FEMALE
483,STEVE ROGERS,Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.,MALE
484,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.",FEMALE
485,STEVE ROGERS,How did you get here?,MALE
486,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Invited.,FEMALE
487,NATASHA ROMANOFF,It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.,FEMALE
488,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.,FEMALE
489,STEVE ROGERS,HYDRA died with the Red Skull.,MALE
490,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.",FEMALE
491,STEVE ROGERS,Prove it.,MALE
492,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accessing archive.  HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.",FEMALE
493,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.",FEMALE
494,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accidents will happen.  HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum.  As I was saying...",FEMALE
495,STEVE ROGERS,What's on this drive?,MALE
496,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.,FEMALE
497,NATASHA ROMANOFF,What kind of algorithm? What does it do?,FEMALE
498,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it.",FEMALE
499,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.",FEMALE
500,STEVE ROGERS,Who fired it?,MALE
501,NATASHA ROMANOFF,S.H.I.E.L.D.,FEMALE
502,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time.",FEMALE
503,BROCK RUMLOW,Call in the asset.,MALE
504,RENATA,"I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?",FEMALE
505,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.",MALE
506,RENATA,"Okay, night-night.",FEMALE
507,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Good night.  Want some milk?  The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six.  They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours.",MALE
508,RENATA,"Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone.",FEMALE
509,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked.",MALE
510,SAM WILSON,"Hey, man.",MALE
511,STEVE ROGERS,I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.,MALE
512,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everyone we know is trying to kill us.,FEMALE
513,SAM WILSON,Not everyone.,MALE
514,STEVE ROGERS,You okay?,MALE
515,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
516,STEVE ROGERS,What's going on?,MALE
517,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.",FEMALE
518,STEVE ROGERS,There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.,MALE
519,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I owe you.,FEMALE
520,STEVE ROGERS,It's okay.,MALE
521,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?",FEMALE
522,STEVE ROGERS,I would now. And I'm always honest.,MALE
523,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.",FEMALE
524,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.",MALE
525,SAM WILSON,I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing.,MALE
526,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?",FEMALE
527,STEVE ROGERS,Pierce.,MALE
528,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.,FEMALE
529,STEVE ROGERS,"But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.",MALE
530,NATASHA ROMANOFF,So was Jasper Sitwell.,FEMALE
531,STEVE ROGERS,"So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?",MALE
532,SAM WILSON,The answer is: you don't.,MALE
533,STEVE ROGERS,What's this?,MALE
534,SAM WILSON,Call it a resume.,MALE
535,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you.  You didn't say he was a para-rescue.",FEMALE
536,STEVE ROGERS,Is this Riley?,MALE
537,SAM WILSON,Yeah.,MALE
538,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?",FEMALE
539,SAM WILSON,No. These.,MALE
540,STEVE ROGERS,I thought you said you were a pilot.,MALE
541,SAM WILSON,I never said pilot.,MALE
542,STEVE ROGERS,"I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.",MALE
543,SAM WILSON,"Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.",MALE
544,STEVE ROGERS,Where can we get our hands on one of these things?,MALE
545,SAM WILSON,"The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.",MALE
546,STEVE ROGERS,Shouldn't be a problem.,MALE
547,STERN,"Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.",MALE
548,JASPER SITWELL,"Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?",MALE
549,STERN,"Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?",MALE
550,JASPER SITWELL,Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.,MALE
551,STERN,"Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it.  This is a nice pin.",MALE
552,JASPER SITWELL,Thank you.,MALE
553,STERN,"Come here.  Hail, HYDRA.  See, it's right there...",MALE
554,JASPER SITWELL,"I just saw that, yeah.",MALE
555,STERN,Should I get it checked?,MALE
556,JASPER SITWELL,"I think you should.   I need a minute. Bring the car around.  Yes, sir?",MALE
557,SAM WILSON,"Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.",MALE
558,JASPER SITWELL,Who is this?,MALE
559,SAM WILSON,"The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock.  Your other ten o'clock.  There you go.",MALE
560,JASPER SITWELL,What do you want?,MALE
561,SAM WILSON,"You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.",MALE
562,JASPER SITWELL,And why would I do that?,MALE
563,SAM WILSON,"Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up.",MALE
564,STEVE ROGERS,Tell me about Zola's algorithm.,MALE
565,JASPER SITWELL,Never heard of it.,MALE
566,STEVE ROGERS,What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?,MALE
567,JASPER SITWELL,"I was throwing up, I get seasick.  Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.",MALE
568,STEVE ROGERS,You're right. It's not. It's hers.,MALE
569,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?",FEMALE
570,STEVE ROGERS,"Lillian. Lip piercing, right?",MALE
571,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, she's cute.",FEMALE
572,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I'm not ready for that.",MALE
573,JASPER SITWELL,Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!,MALE
574,STEVE ROGERS,What targets?,MALE
575,JASPER SITWELL,"You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.",MALE
576,STEVE ROGERS,The Future? How could it know?,MALE
577,JASPER SITWELL,"How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.  Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.",MALE
578,STEVE ROGERS,And what then?,MALE
579,JASPER SITWELL,"Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.",MALE
580,STEVE ROGERS,What then?!,MALE
581,JASPER SITWELL,Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.,MALE
582,JASPER SITWELL,HYDRA doesn't like leaks.,MALE
583,SAM WILSON,So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.,MALE
584,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.",FEMALE
585,STEVE ROGERS,I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.,MALE
586,JASPER SITWELL,"What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea.",MALE
587,SAM WILSON,Shit!,MALE
588,STEVE ROGERS,Hang on!,MALE
589,BUCKY,She's mine.  Find him.,MALE
590,SAM WILSON,"Go, I got this!",MALE
591,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened.  I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes.",FEMALE
592,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Get out of the way! Stay out of the way!,FEMALE
593,STEVE ROGERS,Bucky?,MALE
594,BUCKY,Who the hell is Bucky?,MALE
595,BROCK RUMLOW,"Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down!  Get on your knees! Down!  Don't move.  Put the gun down. Not here. Not here!",MALE
596,STEVE ROGERS,It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.,MALE
597,SAM WILSON,How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.,MALE
598,STEVE ROGERS,"Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...",MALE
599,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"None of that's your fault, Steve.",FEMALE
600,STEVE ROGERS,"Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.",MALE
601,SAM WILSON,We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.,MALE
602,MARIA HILL,Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.  Who's this guy?,FEMALE
603,BROCK RUMLOW,Three holes. Start digging.,MALE
604,MARIA HILL,GSW. She's lost at least a pint.,FEMALE
605,SAM WILSON,Maybe two.,MALE
606,DOCTOR,Let me take her.,FEMALE
607,MARIA HILL,She'll want to see him first.,FEMALE
608,NICK FURY,"About damn time.  Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.",MALE
609,DOCTOR,Don't forget your collapsed lung.,FEMALE
610,NICK FURY,"Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.",MALE
611,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"They cut you open, your heart stopped.",FEMALE
612,NICK FURY,"Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.",MALE
613,STEVE ROGERS,Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?,MALE
614,MARIA HILL,Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.,FEMALE
615,NICK FURY,"Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.",MALE
616,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Sergeant Barnes...,FEMALE
617,STEVE ROGERS,"Bucky, no!",MALE
618,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,The procedure has already started.  You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.  Put him on ice.,FEMALE
619,SCIENTIST #1,"Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic.",MALE
620,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Mission report.  Mission report, now.",MALE
621,BUCKY,The man on the bridge...  Who was he?,MALE
622,ALEXANDER PIERCE,You met him earlier this week on another assignment.,MALE
623,BUCKY,I knew him.,MALE
624,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.",MALE
625,BUCKY,But I knew him.,MALE
626,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Prep him.,MALE
627,SCIENTIST #1,He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.,MALE
628,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Then wipe him and start over.,MALE
629,NICK FURY,"This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, ""Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility."" See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.",MALE
630,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We have to stop the launch.,FEMALE
631,NICK FURY,I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore.,MALE
632,SAM WILSON,What's that?,MALE
633,MARIA HILL,"Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.",FEMALE
634,NICK FURY,We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.,MALE
635,MARIA HILL,"One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.",FEMALE
636,NICK FURY,"We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...",MALE
637,STEVE ROGERS,"We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.",MALE
638,NICK FURY,SHIELD had nothing to do with it.,MALE
639,STEVE ROGERS,"You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.",MALE
640,NICK FURY,Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.,MALE
641,STEVE ROGERS,And how many paid the price before you did?,MALE
642,NICK FURY,"Look, I didn't know about Barnes.",MALE
643,STEVE ROGERS,"Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.",MALE
644,MARIA HILL,He's right.,FEMALE
645,SAM WILSON,"Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.",MALE
646,NICK FURY,"Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.",MALE
647,BUCKY,We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery.,MALE
648,STEVE ROGERS,"I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.",MALE
649,BUCKY,How was it?,MALE
650,STEVE ROGERS,It was okay. She's next to Dad.,MALE
651,BUCKY,I was gonna ask...,MALE
652,STEVE ROGERS,"I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...",MALE
653,BUCKY,"We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash.  Come on.",MALE
654,STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.",MALE
655,BUCKY,"The thing is, you don't have to.  I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.",MALE
656,SAM WILSON,"He's gonna be there, you know?",MALE
657,STEVE ROGERS,I know.,MALE
658,SAM WILSON,"Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.",MALE
659,STEVE ROGERS,I don't know if I can do that.,MALE
660,SAM WILSON,"Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.",MALE
661,STEVE ROGERS,"He will. Gear up, it's time.",MALE
662,SAM WILSON,You gonna wear that?,MALE
663,STEVE ROGERS,"No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform.",MALE
664,SMITHSONIAN GUARD,"Oh, man. I am so fired!",MALE
665,MAN ON PA,We are in final launch sequence.,MALE
666,SHIELD TECH,We are go on guidance.,MALE
667,WOMAN ON PA,All personnel to launch station.,FEMALE
668,ALEXANDER PIERCE,And how was your flight?,MALE
669,COUNCILMAN HAWLEY,Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.,MALE
670,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.",MALE
671,COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,Including Captain America.,MALE
672,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access.",MALE
673,COM TECH #1,I've been parking there for two months.,MALE
674,COM TECH #2,But it's his spot.,MALE
675,COM TECH #1,So where's he been?,MALE
676,COM TECH #2,I think Afghanistan.,MALE
677,COM TECH #1,"Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full.  Well, he could have said something.  Ow!",MALE
678,COM TECH #2,Must be the dish.,MALE
679,COM TECH #1,I'll check it out.,MALE
680,MAN ON PA,Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.,MALE
681,STEVE ROGERS,Excuse us.,MALE
682,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful.",MALE
683,STEVE ROGERS,"Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not.",MALE
684,SAM WILSON,"Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head?",MALE
685,COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,You smug son of a bitch.,MALE
686,COUNCILMAN SINGH,Arrest him.,MALE
687,ALEXANDER PIERCE,I guess I've got the floor.,MALE
688,BROCK RUMLOW,Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now.  Is there a problem?,MALE
689,SHIELD TECH,I'm...,MALE
690,BROCK RUMLOW,Is there a problem?,MALE
691,SHIELD TECH,"I'm sorry, sir.  I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders.",MALE
692,BROCK RUMLOW,Move away from your station.,MALE
693,SHARON CARTER,Like he said!  Captain's orders.,FEMALE
694,BROCK RUMLOW,"You picked the wrong side, Agent.",MALE
695,SHARON CARTER,Depends on where you're standing.,FEMALE
696,SHIELD AGENT,Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door!,MALE
697,MARIA HILL,They're initiating launch.,FEMALE
698,SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?",MALE
699,STEVE ROGERS,"If they're shooting at you, they're bad.",MALE
700,SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.",MALE
701,STEVE ROGERS,You okay?,MALE
702,SAM WILSON,I'm not dead yet.,MALE
703,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution?  And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?",MALE
704,COUNCILMAN SINGH,Not if it was your switch.,MALE
705,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?,FEMALE
706,CHARLIE WEAPONS TECH,Satellites in range at three thousand feet.,MALE
707,MARIA HILL,"Falcon, status?",FEMALE
708,SAM WILSON,"Engaging.  Alright, Cap, I'm in.  Shit!",MALE
709,MARIA HILL,"Eight minutes, Cap.",FEMALE
710,STEVE ROGERS,Working on it.,MALE
711,COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,What are you doing?,MALE
712,ALEXANDER PIERCE,She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.,MALE
713,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Including HYDRA's.,FEMALE
714,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden.  Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?",MALE
715,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Are you?,FEMALE
716,STEVE ROGERS,Alpha locked.,MALE
717,MARIA HILL,"Falcon, where are you now?",FEMALE
718,SAM WILSON,"I had to take a detour!  Oh, yeah!  I'm in. Bravo locked.",MALE
719,MARIA HILL,"Two down, one to go.",FEMALE
720,SHIELD PILOT,"All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.",MALE
721,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.",MALE
722,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Don't worry, company's coming.",FEMALE
723,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Did you get my flowers?  I'm glad you're here, Nick.",MALE
724,NICK FURY,Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.,MALE
725,ALEXANDER PIERCE,You know how the game works.,MALE
726,NICK FURY,So why make me head of SHIELD?,MALE
727,ALEXANDER PIERCE,Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.,MALE
728,NICK FURY,I did what I did to protect people.,MALE
729,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.",MALE
730,NICK FURY,"No, I have the courage not to.",MALE
731,SHIELD COMPUTER,Retinal scanner active.,FEMALE
732,ALEXANDER PIERCE,You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?,MALE
733,NICK FURY,"I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary...  You need to keep both eyes open.",MALE
734,SHIELD COMPUTER,Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.,FEMALE
735,MARIA HILL,Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow.  Six minutes.,FEMALE
736,STEVE ROGERS,"Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.",MALE
737,SAM WILSON,Roger! Let me know when you're ready.,MALE

739,SAM WILSON,"You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.",MALE
740,STEVE ROGERS,I had a big breakfast.,MALE
741,SAM WILSON,"Steve!  Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay?",MALE
742,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier.  Where are you?",MALE
743,SAM WILSON,"I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.",MALE

753,SAM WILSON,I'm on it.,MALE
754,STEVE ROGERS,"People are gonna die, Buck. I can't let that happen.  Please, don't make me do this.",MALE
755,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Done.  And it's trending.,FEMALE
756,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Unless you want two inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down.  That was armed the moment you pinned it on.",MALE
757,STEVE ROGERS,Drop it! Drop it!,MALE
758,BROCK RUMLOW,"I'm on forty-one, headed towards the south-west stairwell.  This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA, just order. And order only comes through pain. You ready for yours?",MALE
759,SAM WILSON,"Man, shut the hell up.",MALE
760,ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Lieutenant, how much longer?",MALE
761,CHARLIE XO,Sixty-five seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.,MALE

802,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I do.,FEMALE
803,COMMITTEE GENERAL,Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?,MALE
804,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don't know what there is left left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.,FEMALE
805,COMMITTEE GENERAL,"Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.",MALE
806,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.",FEMALE
807,COMMITTEE GENERAL,Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.,MALE
808,SCUDDER,"Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.",MALE
809,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?,FEMALE
810,SCUDDER,Do enlighten us.,MALE
811,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we helped make it that way. But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it. So if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You'll know where to find me.",FEMALE
812,NICK FURY,"So, you've experienced this sort of thing before?",MALE
813,STEVE ROGERS,You get used to it.,MALE
814,NICK FURY,"We've been data-mining HYDRA's files. Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship. I'm headed to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.",MALE
815,STEVE ROGERS,There's something I gotta do first.,MALE
816,NICK FURY,"How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.",MALE
817,SAM WILSON,I'm more of a soldier than a spy.,MALE
818,NICK FURY,"Alright then.  Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here.",MALE
819,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You should be honored, that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.",FEMALE
820,STEVE ROGERS,Not going with him?,MALE
821,NATASHA ROMANOFF,No.,FEMALE
822,STEVE ROGERS,Not staying here?,MALE
823,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.",FEMALE
824,STEVE ROGERS,That might take a while.,MALE
825,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev.  Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.",FEMALE
826,STEVE ROGERS,She's not a nurse.,MALE
827,NATASHA ROMANOFF,And you're not a SHIELD agent.,FEMALE
828,STEVE ROGERS,What was her name again?,MALE
829,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Sharon. She's nice.  Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread.",FEMALE
830,SAM WILSON,You're going after him?,MALE
831,STEVE ROGERS,You don't have to come with me.,MALE
832,SAM WILSON,I know. When do we start?,MALE
833,LIST,It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.,MALE
834,BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,Everything he knows about.,MALE
835,LIST,"Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...",MALE
836,BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,"HYDRA, SHIELD, two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.  What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We've only scratched the surface and already...  There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.",MALE
837,LIST,What about the volunteers?,MALE
838,BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.,MALE
839,LIST,And the survivors?,MALE
840,BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,"The twins.  Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.",MALE
