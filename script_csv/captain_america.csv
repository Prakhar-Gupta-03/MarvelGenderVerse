151,GILMORE HODGE,"Yes, sir.",MALE
152,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men…  And because they’re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers.,MALE

161,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.,MALE
162,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he’ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him.",MALE

167,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.,MALE
168,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Do you know how long it took to set up this project?,MALE
169,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Yeah, I know.",MALE
170,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What’s-His-Name’s committees?,MALE
171,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.",MALE
172,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, he obeys orders. He’s a soldier.",MALE
173,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,He’s a bully.,MALE
174,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You don’t win wars with niceness, doctor.  You win war with guts.  Grenade!",MALE
175,STEVE ROGERS,Get away! Get back!,MALE
176,OFFICER,It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.,FEMALE
177,STEVE ROGERS,Is this is a test?,MALE
178,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,He’s still skinny.,MALE
179,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,May I?,MALE
180,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah.,MALE
181,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Can’t sleep?,MALE
182,STEVE ROGERS,"I got the jitters, I guess.",MALE
183,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Me, too.",MALE
184,STEVE ROGERS,Can I ask you a question?,MALE
185,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Just one?,MALE
186,STEVE ROGERS,Why me?,MALE
187,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"I suppose that is the only question that matters.  This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the…  And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, ""You."" He says, ""You will make us strong."" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.",MALE
188,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Schmidt must become that superior man.,MALE
189,STEVE ROGERS,Did it make him stronger?,MALE
190,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.",MALE
191,STEVE ROGERS,Thanks. I think.,MALE
192,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.",MALE
193,STEVE ROGERS,To the little guys.,MALE
194,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.,MALE
195,STEVE ROGERS,All right. We’ll drink it after.,MALE
196,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,No! I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!,MALE
197,RED SKULL,Is there something in particular you need?,MALE
198,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I understand you found him.,MALE
199,RED SKULL,See for yourself.  You disapprove.,MALE
200,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he will succeed.  Again.,MALE
201,RED SKULL,"His serum is the Allies’ only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.",MALE
202,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Shall I give the order?,MALE
203,RED SKULL,It has been given.,MALE
204,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Good.,MALE
205,RED SKULL,Dr. Zola.  What do you think?,MALE
206,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,A masterpiece.,MALE
207,STEVE ROGERS,I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.,MALE
208,PEGGY CARTER,Did you have something against running away?,FEMALE
209,STEVE ROGERS,"You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?",MALE
210,PEGGY CARTER,I know a little of what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.,FEMALE
211,STEVE ROGERS,"I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…",MALE
212,PEGGY CARTER,"You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?",FEMALE
213,STEVE ROGERS,This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.,MALE
214,PEGGY CARTER,You must have danced?,FEMALE
215,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.",MALE
216,PEGGY CARTER,For what?,FEMALE
217,STEVE ROGERS,The right partner.,MALE
218,PEGGY CARTER,This way.,FEMALE
219,STEVE ROGERS,What are we doing here?,MALE
220,PEGGY CARTER,Follow me.,FEMALE
221,ANTIQUE STORE OWNER,Wonderful weather this morning isn’t it?,FEMALE
222,PEGGY CARTER,"Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.",FEMALE
223,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Good morning.  Please, not now.  Are you ready?  Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.",MALE
224,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.",MALE
225,SENATOR BRANDT,Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?,MALE
226,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given me the generators I requisitioned…",MALE
227,SENATOR BRANDT,"A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.  Oh, this is…",MALE
228,HEINZ KRUGER,"Fred Clemson, State Department.  If this project of yours comes through, we’d like to see it used for something other than headlines.",MALE
229,SENATOR BRANDT,Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.,MALE
230,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Comfortable?,MALE
231,STEVE ROGERS,It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?,MALE
232,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?",MALE
233,HOWARD STARK,Levels at 100%.,MALE
234,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Good.,MALE
235,HOWARD STARK,"We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we’ll ever be.",MALE
236,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Agent Carter? Don’t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?,MALE
237,PEGGY CARTER,"Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.",FEMALE
238,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Good.  Do you hear me? is this on?  Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.",MALE
239,STEVE ROGERS,That wasn’t so bad.,MALE
240,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"That was penicillin.  Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one.  Now, Mr. Stark.   Steven, can you hear me?",MALE
241,STEVE ROGERS,"It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?",MALE
242,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,We will proceed.,MALE
243,HOWARD STARK,That’s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That’s 40 %.,MALE
244,SSR DOCTOR,Vital signs are normal.,MALE
245,HOWARD STARK,That’s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.,MALE
246,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Steven!,MALE

258,HOWARD STARK,We actually did it.,MALE
259,PEGGY CARTER,How do you feel?,FEMALE
260,STEVE ROGERS,Taller.,MALE
261,PEGGY CARTER,You look taller.,FEMALE
262,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?",MALE
263,SENATOR BRANDT,"I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor.",MALE
264,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Thank you, sir.",MALE
265,DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Stop him!,MALE
266,TAXI DRIVER,"What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy’s been shot!",MALE

277,HEINZ KRUGER,"The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA!",MALE
278,HUTTER,"The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.",MALE
279,SCHNEIDER,You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.,MALE
280,RED SKULL,Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.,MALE
281,ROEDER,You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.,MALE
282,SCHNEIDER,"The Führer feels… How does he put it? ""The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!""",MALE
283,RED SKULL,"Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you.  Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.",MALE
284,ROEDER,And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?,MALE
285,RED SKULL,"Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.",MALE
286,ROEDER,Your enemies?,MALE
287,RED SKULL,"My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.",MALE

296,HYDRA TECHNICIANS,Hail HYDRA!,FEMALE
297,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Hail HYDRA!,MALE
298,STEVE ROGERS,Think you got enough?,MALE
299,PEGGY CARTER,"Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.",FEMALE
300,STEVE ROGERS,He deserved more than this.,MALE
301,PEGGY CARTER,"If it could only work once, he’d be proud it was you.",FEMALE
302,SENATOR BRANDT,"Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.",MALE
303,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?  What have we got here?,MALE
304,HOWARD STARK,"Speaking modestly, I’m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don’t know what’s inside this thing or how it works. We’re not even close to this technology.",MALE
305,SENATOR BRANDT,Then who is?,MALE
306,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,HYDRA. I’m sure you’ve been reading our briefings.,MALE
307,SENATOR BRANDT,"I’m on a number of committees, Colonel.",MALE
308,PEGGY CARTER,HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.,FEMALE
309,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"HYDRA’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he’s invincible.",MALE
310,SENATOR BRANDT,So what are you gonna do about it?,MALE
311,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.,MALE
312,PEGGY CARTER,Colonel?,FEMALE
313,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You’re flying to London tonight.",MALE
314,STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.",MALE
315,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,You’re an experiment. You’re going to Alamogordo.,MALE
316,STEVE ROGERS,The serum worked.,MALE
317,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.,MALE
318,SENATOR BRANDT,"With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I’ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country’s seen it.  Paper. The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?",MALE
319,STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, that’s all I want.",MALE
320,SENATOR BRANDT,"Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.",MALE
321,STEVE ROGERS,I don’t know if I can do this.,MALE
322,BRANDT'S AIDE,"Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi’s. Bing bang boom. You’re an American hero.",MALE
323,STEVE ROGERS,It’s just not how I pictured getting there.,MALE
324,BRANDT'S AIDE,"The senator’s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you’ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield.",MALE
325,USO SINGER,"Who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way?",MALE
326,STEVE ROGERS,Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there’s still a way all of us can fight.,MALE
327,USO SINGER,"Who vows to fight like a man, for what’s right, night and day?",MALE
328,STEVE ROGERS,Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,MALE
329,USO SINGER,"Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.",MALE
330,DIRECTOR,"Cut. Guys, don’t look ath the camera.",MALE
331,USO SINGER,We can’t ignore there’s a threat and a war we must win.,MALE
332,STEVE ROGERS,Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,MALE
333,USO SINGER,"Who’ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who’ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who’s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.",MALE
334,STEVE ROGERS,"We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love.",MALE
335,KIDS IN USO AUDIENCE,Turn around! He’s right behind you!,NEUTRAL
336,STEVE ROGERS,"Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.",MALE
337,USO SINGER,"Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who’ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who’s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we’re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it’s no one but Captain America. Who’ll finish what they began? Who’ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan!",MALE
338,STEVE ROGERS,How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?  Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.,MALE
339,ARMY HECKLER#1,I already volunteered! How do you think I got here?  Bring back the girls!,FEMALE
340,STEVE ROGERS,I think they only know the one song. But um…let me…I’ll…I’ll see what I can do.,MALE
341,ARMY HECKLER#1,"You do that, sweetheart.",FEMALE
342,ARMY HECKLER#2,"Nice boots, Tinker Bell!",FEMALE
343,STEVE ROGERS,"Come on, guys. We’re all on the same team here.",MALE
344,ARMY HECKLER#3,"Hey, Captain! Sign this!",FEMALE
345,ARMY HECKLER#4,Bring back the girls!,FEMALE
346,BRANDT'S AIDE,"Don’t worry, pal. They’ll warm up to you. Don’t worry.",MALE
347,PEGGY CARTER,"Hello, Steve.",FEMALE
348,STEVE ROGERS,Hi.,MALE
349,PEGGY CARTER,Hi.,FEMALE
350,STEVE ROGERS,What are you doin’ here?,MALE
351,PEGGY CARTER,Officially I’m not here at all. That was quite a performance.,FEMALE
352,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.,MALE
353,PEGGY CARTER,"I understand you’re ""America’s New Hope""?",FEMALE
354,STEVE ROGERS,Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.,MALE
355,PEGGY CARTER,Is that Senator Brandt I hear?,FEMALE
356,STEVE ROGERS,At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.,MALE
357,PEGGY CARTER,"And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know?  What?",FEMALE
358,STEVE ROGERS,"You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights.  They look like they’ve been through hell.",MALE
359,PEGGY CARTER,These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.,FEMALE
360,STEVE ROGERS,The one-oh-seventh?,MALE
361,PEGGY CARTER,What?,FEMALE
362,STEVE ROGERS,Come on!  Colonel Phillips.,MALE
363,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?",MALE
364,STEVE ROGERS,I need the casualty list from Azzano.,MALE
365,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You don’t get to give me orders, son.",MALE
366,STEVE ROGERS,I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.,MALE
367,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.,MALE
368,STEVE ROGERS,"Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…",MALE
369,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I can spell.  I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.,MALE
370,STEVE ROGERS,What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?,MALE
371,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Yeah! It’s called winning the war.,MALE
372,STEVE ROGERS,"But if you know where they are, why not at least…?",MALE
373,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. But I don’t expect you to understand that, because you’re a chorus girl.",MALE
374,STEVE ROGERS,I think I understand just fine.,MALE
375,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes.",MALE
376,STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir. I do.",MALE
377,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.",MALE
378,PEGGY CARTER,What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?,FEMALE
379,STEVE ROGERS,If that’s what it takes.,MALE
380,PEGGY CARTER,"You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.",FEMALE
381,STEVE ROGERS,You don’t know that.,MALE
382,PEGGY CARTER,"Even so, he’s devising a strategy. If he detects…",FEMALE
383,STEVE ROGERS,"By the time he’s done that, it could be too late!  You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?",MALE
384,PEGGY CARTER,Every word.,FEMALE
385,STEVE ROGERS,Then you gotta let me go.,MALE
386,PEGGY CARTER,I can do more than that.,FEMALE
387,BRANDT'S AIDE,"On stage, girls. Five minutes!",MALE
388,USO GIRL,Where’s my helmet?,FEMALE
389,BRANDT'S AIDE,Has anyone seen Rogers?,MALE
390,PEGGY CARTER,"The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.",FEMALE
391,HOWARD STARK,We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.,MALE
392,STEVE ROGERS,"Just get me as close as you can.  You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.",MALE
393,PEGGY CARTER,And you won’t?,FEMALE
394,STEVE ROGERS,"Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.",MALE
395,PEGGY CARTER,They will undoubtedly shoot back.,FEMALE
396,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’.",MALE
397,HOWARD STARK,"Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue.",MALE
398,PEGGY CARTER,"Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen. He’s mad enough to brave this airspace, we’re lucky to have him.",FEMALE
399,STEVE ROGERS,So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?,MALE
400,PEGGY CARTER,This is your transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.,FEMALE
401,STEVE ROGERS,Are you sure this thing works?,MALE
402,HOWARD STARK,"It’s been tested more than you, pal.",MALE
403,PEGGY CARTER,Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in.,FEMALE
404,STEVE ROGERS,"As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!",MALE
405,PEGGY CARTER,You can’t give me orders!,FEMALE
406,STEVE ROGERS,The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain!,MALE
407,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.",MALE
408,RED SKULL,Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.,MALE
409,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"But the prisoners, I’m not sure they have the strength.",MALE
410,RED SKULL,"Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.",MALE
411,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Not now!,MALE
412,DUM DUM DUGAN,"You know, Fritz, one of these days, I’m gonna have a stick of my own.",MALE
413,STEVE ROGERS,Fellas.,MALE
414,HYDRA GUARDS,Ah!,MALE
415,GABE JONES,Who are you supposed to be?,MALE
416,STEVE ROGERS,I’m… Captain America.,MALE
417,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,I beg your pardon?,MALE
418,DUM DUM DUGAN,"What, are we taking everybody?",MALE
419,JIM MORITA,"I’m from Fresno, Ace.",MALE
420,STEVE ROGERS,Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.,MALE
421,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"There’s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one’s ever come back from it.",MALE
422,STEVE ROGERS,"All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give ‘em hell. I’ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.",MALE
423,GABE JONES,Wait! You know what you’re doin’?,MALE
424,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.,MALE
425,JIM MORITA,You know how to use that thing?  Okay.,MALE
426,RED SKULL,What is happening?,MALE
427,DUM DUM DUGAN,Hey. Not exactly a Buick.,MALE
428,GABE JONES,That one. Zündung.,MALE
429,DUM DUM DUGAN,Zündung?,MALE
430,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Get this thing going, Dugan!",MALE
431,DUM DUM DUGAN,I didn’t know you spoke German.,MALE
432,GABE JONES,"Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.",MALE
433,DUM DUM DUGAN,Didn’t ask for the resume.,MALE
434,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"No, no! What are you doing?",MALE
435,RED SKULL,Our forces are outmatched.,MALE
436,JIM MORITA,Keep moving! Grab those grenades!,MALE
437,JAMES BARNES,Sergeant. 32557…,MALE
438,STEVE ROGERS,"Bucky? Oh, my God.",MALE
439,JAMES BARNES,Is that…,MALE
440,STEVE ROGERS,It’s me. It’s Steve.,MALE
441,JAMES BARNES,Steve?,MALE
442,STEVE ROGERS,Come on.,MALE
443,JAMES BARNES,Steve.,MALE
444,STEVE ROGERS,I thought you were dead.,MALE
445,JAMES BARNES,I thought you were smaller.,MALE
446,STEVE ROGERS,Come on.,MALE
447,JAMES BARNES,What happened to you?,MALE
448,STEVE ROGERS,I joined the Army.,MALE
449,JAMES BARNES,Did it hurt?,MALE
450,STEVE ROGERS,A little.,MALE
451,JAMES BARNES,Is it permanent?,MALE
452,STEVE ROGERS,So far.,MALE
453,RED SKULL,"Captain America! How exciting! I’m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive.",MALE
454,STEVE ROGERS,You’ve got no idea.,MALE
455,RED SKULL,"Haven’t I?  No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success!",MALE
456,JAMES BARNES,"You don’t have one of those, do you?",MALE
457,RED SKULL,"You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!",MALE
458,STEVE ROGERS,"Then how come you’re running?  Come on, let’s go. Up.",MALE
459,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Sir? Are we going to the roof?  What about me? Where will I sit?,MALE
460,RED SKULL,"Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch.",MALE
461,STEVE ROGERS,Let’s go. One at a time.,MALE
462,JAMES BARNES,Gotta be a rope or something!,MALE
463,STEVE ROGERS,Just go! Get out of here!,MALE
464,JAMES BARNES,No! Not without you!,MALE
465,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.",MALE
466,PEGGY CARTER,The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.,FEMALE
467,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.",MALE
468,CORPORAL,"Yes, sir.",MALE
469,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I can’t touch Stark. He’s rich and he’s the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.,MALE
470,PEGGY CARTER,"With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I don’t think Captain Rogers did either.",FEMALE
471,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.",MALE
472,PEGGY CARTER,It wasn’t that. I had faith.,FEMALE
473,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well, I hope that’s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.  What the hell’s going on out there?",MALE
474,MAN#1,Look who it is!,MALE
475,STEVE ROGERS,Some of theres men need medical attention.,MALE
476,MAN#2,"Medic, we got wounded.",MALE
477,STEVE ROGERS,I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.,MALE
478,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,That won’t be necessary.,MALE
479,STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir.",MALE
480,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Faith, huh?",MALE
481,PEGGY CARTER,You’re late.,FEMALE
482,STEVE ROGERS,Couldn’t call my ride.,MALE
483,JAMES BARNES,Hey! Let’s hear it for Captain America.,MALE
484,SENATOR BRANDT,"I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America!  Captain America!  Captain, that’s your cue!",MALE
485,GENERAL,I thought he’d be taller.,MALE
486,STEVE ROGERS,"The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.  And the sixth one was… about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.  I just got a quick look.",MALE
487,PEGGY CARTER,"Well, nobody’s perfect.",FEMALE
488,STEVE ROGERS,These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.,MALE
489,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.",MALE
490,PEGGY CARTER,What about us?,FEMALE
491,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?",MALE
492,STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.",MALE
493,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,We’re already putting together the best men.,MALE
494,STEVE ROGERS,"With all due respect, sir. So am I.",MALE
495,DUM DUM DUGAN,"So, let’s get this straight.",MALE
496,GABE JONES,"We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?",MALE
497,STEVE ROGERS,Pretty much.,MALE
498,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Sounds rather fun, actually.",MALE
499,JIM MORITA,I’m in.,MALE
500,GABE JONES,We’re in.,MALE
501,DUM DUM DUGAN,"Hell, I’ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.",MALE
502,STEVE ROGERS,What’s that?,MALE
503,DUM DUM DUGAN,Open a tab.,MALE
504,JIM MORITA,"Well, that was easy.",MALE
505,STEVE ROGERS,Another round.,MALE
506,BARKEEPER,Where are they putting all this stuff?,FEMALE
507,JAMES BARNES,See? I told you. They’re all idiots.,MALE
508,STEVE ROGERS,How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?,MALE
509,JAMES BARNES,"Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him. But you’re keeping the outfit, right?",MALE
510,STEVE ROGERS,You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.,MALE
511,PEGGY CARTER,Captain.,FEMALE
512,STEVE ROGERS,Agent Carter.,MALE
513,JAMES BARNES,Ma’am.,MALE
514,PEGGY CARTER,Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?,FEMALE
515,STEVE ROGERS,Sounds good.,MALE
516,PEGGY CARTER,I see you top squad is prepping for duty.,FEMALE
517,JAMES BARNES,You don’t like music?,MALE
518,PEGGY CARTER,"I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.",FEMALE
519,JAMES BARNES,Then what are we waiting for?,MALE
520,STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.",MALE
521,JAMES BARNES,I’m invisible. I’m…I’m turning into you. It’s like some horrible dream.,MALE
522,STEVE ROGERS,Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend.,MALE
523,HOWARD STARK,Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about.  Write that down.,MALE
524,STEVE ROGERS,Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.,MALE
525,PVT. LORRAINE,He’s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you’re welcome to wait.  I read about what you did.,FEMALE
526,STEVE ROGERS,"Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.",MALE
527,PVT. LORRAINE,Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.,FEMALE
528,STEVE ROGERS,"Really, it’s not a big deal.",MALE
529,PVT. LORRAINE,Tell that to their wives.,FEMALE
530,STEVE ROGERS,Uh…I don’t think they were all married.,MALE
531,PVT. LORRAINE,You’re a hero.,FEMALE
532,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really.",MALE
533,PVT. LORRAINE,"The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh…seeing as they’re not here.",FEMALE
534,PEGGY CARTER,Captain!  We’re ready for you. If you’re not otherwise occupied.,FEMALE
535,STEVE ROGERS,"Agent Carter, wait.",MALE
536,PEGGY CARTER,Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.,FEMALE
537,STEVE ROGERS,"Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.",MALE
538,PEGGY CARTER,"I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.",FEMALE
539,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?",MALE
540,PEGGY CARTER,You still don’t know a bloody thing about women!,FEMALE
541,HOWARD STARK,"Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.",MALE
542,STEVE ROGERS,Really? I didn’t think…,MALE
543,HOWARD STARK,"Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what’s goin’ on in a woman’s head, it’s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer.  Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra’s not going to attack you with a pocket knife.  I hear you’re uh… kinda attached?",MALE
544,STEVE ROGERS,It’s handier than you might think.,MALE
545,HOWARD STARK,I took the liberty of coming up with some options.  This one’s fun. She’s been fitted with electrical relays. It’ll allow you to…,MALE
546,STEVE ROGERS,What about this one?,MALE
547,HOWARD STARK,No! No! That’s just a prototype.,MALE
548,STEVE ROGERS,What’s it made of?,MALE
549,HOWARD STARK,Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It’s completely vibration absorbent.,MALE
550,STEVE ROGERS,How come it’s not a standard issue?,MALE
551,HOWARD STARK,That’s the rarest metal on earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.,MALE
552,PEGGY CARTER,"You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.",FEMALE
553,STEVE ROGERS,What do you think?,MALE
554,PEGGY CARTER,Yes. I think it works.,FEMALE
555,STEVE ROGERS,I had some ideas about the uniform.,MALE
556,HOWARD STARK,"Whatever you want, pal.",MALE
557,RED SKULL,"You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!",MALE
558,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,This is hardly my area of expertise. I…I merely develop the weapons. I…I cannot fire them.,MALE
559,RED SKULL,"Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.",MALE
560,GUARD,Sir!,MALE
561,FACILITY MANAGER,"I’m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.",FEMALE
562,RED SKULL,Evidently not.,MALE
563,JAMES BARNES,Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?,MALE
564,STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I and I threw up?",MALE
565,JAMES BARNES,"This isn’t payback, is it?",MALE
566,STEVE ROGERS,Now why would I do that?,MALE
567,GABE JONES,"We were right. Dr. Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.",MALE
568,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Let’s get going, because they’re moving like the devil.",MALE
569,STEVE ROGERS,"We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.",MALE
570,JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,Mind the gap.,MALE
571,DUM DUM DUGAN,"Better get moving, bugs!",MALE
572,JACQUES DERNEIR,Maintenant!,MALE
573,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Stop him! Fire again!,MALE
574,JAMES BARNES,I had him on the ropes.,MALE
575,STEVE ROGERS,I know you did.  Get down!,MALE
576,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Fire again! Kill him! Now!,MALE
577,STEVE ROGERS,Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!,MALE
578,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Sit down.,MALE
579,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,What is this?,MALE
580,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Steak.,MALE
581,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,What is in it?,MALE
582,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?",MALE
583,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I don’t eat meat.,MALE
584,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Why not?,MALE
585,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,It disagrees with me.,MALE
586,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we’ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here’s my brilliant theory.  You wanna live.",MALE
587,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"You’re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.",MALE
588,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I bought you dinner.,MALE
589,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"‘Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.’",MALE
590,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven’t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.",MALE
591,DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Schmidt will know this is a lie.,MALE
592,COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"He’s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You’re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers’ closest friend. So, I wouldn’t count on the very best of protection. There’s you or Schmidt. It’s just the hand you’ve been dealt.",MALE
