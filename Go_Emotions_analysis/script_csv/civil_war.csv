NATASHA ROMANOFF,Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,Who's your buyer?,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What did you say?,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, ""Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go."" And you're coming with me.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Oh my . . .  Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.,MALE

HOWARD STARK,Who's the homeless person on the couch?,MALE
TONY STARK,This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.,MALE

HOWARD STARK,We might have to make a quick stop.,MALE
TONY STARK,"At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.",MALE
HOWARD STARK,"You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.",MALE
MARIA STARK,"He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.",MALE
TONY STARK,"That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.",MALE
TONY STARK,"It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? ""To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.",MALE
TONY STARK,"No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.",MALE
TONY STARK,Go break some eggs.,MALE
MIT TEACHER,"Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, ""Ooh, gross,"" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .",MALE
TONY STARK,"Restroom's this way, yeah?",MALE
MIT TEACHER,Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.,MALE
STARK'S ASSISTANT,"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.",FEMALE

MRS. SPENCER,"That was nice, what you did for those young people.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.",MALE
MRS. SPENCER,They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Are you going up?,MALE
MRS. SPENCER,I'm right where I want to be.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.",MALE
MRS. SPENCER,I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.,FEMALE
MRS. SPENCER,His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.,FEMALE
MRS. SPENCER,"Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.",FEMALE
NEWS ANCHOR,"11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.",MALE
T'CHALA,"Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.",MALE
NEWS ANCHOR,The Wakanda king went on to . . .,MALE
NEWS ANCHOR,"They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's my fault.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,That's not true.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Rumlow said ""Bucky"" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,And people died. It's on me.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It's on both of us.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis! We talked about this.,FEMALE
VISION,"Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .",MALE
VISION,Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you. We'll be right down.,MALE
VISION,"I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We know who it is?,MALE
VISION,The Secretary of State.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word ""vigilantes"".",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?",FEMALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"How about ""dangerous""? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,New York.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Washington DC.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Sokovia.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Lagos.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Okay. That's enough.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"So, there are contingencies.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Talk it over.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,And if we come to a decision you don't like?,FEMALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Then you retire.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Hello? Is this your car out front?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,I jumped the curb.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.",MALE
VASILY KARPOV,No. No cops.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Thank you.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.",MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"""Mission report: December 16, 1991.""",MALE
VASILY KARPOV,Who are you?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.",MALE
VASILY KARPOV,How did you find me?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.",MALE
VASILY KARPOV,What do you want?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Mission report. December 16. 1991.,MALE
VASILY KARPOV,Go . . . to . . . hell.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.,MALE
VASILY KARPOV,Hail HYDRA.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.",MALE
SAM WILSON,So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, ""No, that's cool. We got it. """,MALE
SAM WILSON,How long are you going to play both sides?,MALE
VISION,I have an equation.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Oh, this will clear it up.",MALE
VISION,"In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying it's our fault?,MALE
VISION,I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Boom.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's because he's already made up his mind.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Boy, you know me so well.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.",MALE
TONY STARK,"That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.",MALE
TONY STARK,"He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.",MALE
TONY STARK,"There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.",MALE
TONY STARK,Who said we're giving up?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.",MALE
TONY STARK,"That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.",MALE
TONY STARK,"If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying they'll come for me.,FEMALE
VISION,We would protect you.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Maybe Tony's right.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -",FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, I want to take it back now.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I have to go.,MALE
PRIEST,"And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.,FEMALE
SHARON CARTER,"She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.",FEMALE
SHARON CARTER,"I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say "" No, you move.""",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"She had you back, too.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who else signed?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Tony. Rhodey. Vision.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Clint?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Says he's retired.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Wanda?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,TBD. I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What are we giving up to do it?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then what are you doing here?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't want you to be alone.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come here.,FEMALE
NEWS ANCHOR,At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.,MALE
UN STAFFER,"Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yes?,FEMALE
UN STAFFER,These need your signature.  Thank you.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thanks.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, I'm not.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why? You don't approve of all this?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.",MALE
T'CHALA,Unless you need to move a piano.,MALE
T'CHALA,Father.,MALE
T'CHALA,Son. Miss Romanoff.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yes, so am I.",FEMALE
MAN ON SPEAKERS,If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.,MALE
T'CHALA,That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thank you.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.",MALE
T'CHALA,"I'm happy, Father.",MALE
T'CHALA,Thank you.,MALE
T'CHALA,Thank you.,MALE
T'CHALA,"When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative.  Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.",MALE
T'CHALA,EVERYBODY GET DOWN!,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Very practical.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,And stylish.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,CIA has you stationed over here now?,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right. Right. Sounds fun.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"I know, right?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .,MALE
SHARON CARTER,You mean when I was doing my job.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did Peggy know?,MALE
SHARON CARTER,She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you.  Thanks for walking me back.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sure.,MALE
SAM WILSON,Steve. There's something you gotta see.,MALE
NEWS ANCHOR,A bomb hidden in a news van . . .,MALE
SHARON CARTER,Who's coordinating?,FEMALE
NEWS ANCHOR,. . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,Good. They're solid. Forensics?,FEMALE
NEWS ANCHOR,"More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,I have to go to work.,FEMALE
SHARON CARTER,"Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm very sorry.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,That sounds very peaceful.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,My father thought so.  I am not my father.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You alright?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.  I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying you'll arrest me?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Because I'm the one least likely to die trying.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Shit.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,She tell you to stay out of it?  Might have a point.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He'd do it for me.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,"Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this.  My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.,FEMALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.,MALE
GERMAN INNKEEPER,Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.,MALE
GERMAN INNKEEPER,"Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.",MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,It's okay. This is wonderful.,MALE
GERMAN INNKEEPER,I'll put this on your . . .,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.",MALE
BUCKY,"How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Understood.  Do you know me?,MALE
BUCKY,You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.,MALE
SAM WILSON,They've set the perimeter.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.,MALE
BUCKY,I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.,MALE
SAM WILSON,They're entering the building.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.",MALE
BUCKY,That's smart. Good strategy.,MALE
SAM WILSON,They're on the roof. I'm compromised.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.",MALE
BUCKY,It always ends in a fight.,MALE
SAM WILSON,5 seconds.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You pulled me from the river. Why?,MALE
BUCKY,I don't know.,MALE
SAM WILSON,3 seconds!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, you do.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Breach! Breach! Breach!,MALE
GSG-9 SOLDIER,Shoot the door!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.",MALE
BUCKY,I'm not gonna kill anyone.,MALE
GSG-9 SOLDIER,Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Come on, man.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sam, southwest rooftop.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Who the hell's the other guy?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,About to find out.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sam.,MALE
SAM WILSON,Got him.,MALE
GSG-9 DRIVER,Stand down! Stand down!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sam, I can't shake this guy.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Right behind you.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Stand down, now.  Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal.",MALE
GSG-9 SOLDIER,What's the order?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Your highness.,MALE
VISION,A pinch of paprika.' A pinch.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that paprikash?,FEMALE
VISION,I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Spirits lifted.,FEMALE
VISION,"In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,May I?,FEMALE
VISION,Please. Wanda?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Hmm.,FEMALE
VISION,"No one dislikes you, Wanda.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Thanks.,FEMALE
VISION,"Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you?,FEMALE
VISION,"My amygdala is synthetic, so . . .",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . .  I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.",FEMALE
VISION,"Do you know, I don't know what this is?  Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Are you afraid of it?,FEMALE
VISION,"I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.,FEMALE
VISION,"Alternatively, we could order a pizza?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Vision, are you not letting me leave?",FEMALE
VISION,It is a question of safety.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I can protect myself.,FEMALE
VISION,Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,And what do you want?,FEMALE
VISION,For people to see you . . . as I do.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"So, you like cats?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sam.,MALE
SAM WILSON,What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?,MALE
T'CHALA,"The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What's gonna happen to him?,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What about our lawyer?,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,"Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.",MALE
SAM WILSON,I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,"You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?",MALE
T'CHALA,I don't intend on going anywhere.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,He's alive.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Try not to break anything while we fix this.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Consequences'?,MALE
TONY STARK,Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not getting that shield back, am I?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.",FEMALE
SAM WILSON,That's cold.,MALE
TONY STARK,Warmer than jail.,MALE
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,This can't be right. What the hell?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.  FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Some would say it brought our country closer to war.,MALE
TONY STARK,"See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.,MALE
TONY STARK,"We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Pregnant?,MALE
TONY STARK,No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.",MALE
TONY STARK,"A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.  In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don't mean to make things difficult.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I know, because you're a very polite person.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, you don't.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"No, I don't. Sometimes . . .",MALE
TONY STARK,"Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Wanda? What about Wanda?,MALE
TONY STARK,"She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .",MALE
TONY STARK,What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,She's not a US citizen.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Oh, come on, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,She's a kid!,MALE
TONY STARK,GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You keep telling yourself that.  Hate to break up the set.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?",MALE
SHARON CARTER,The receipt for your gear.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Bird costume'? Come on.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,I didn't write it.,FEMALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.",MALE
BUCKY,My name is Bucky.,MALE
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,Hello? Hey. I have a big one for you.  Okay. Here. Just sign here.,MALE
CUSTODIAN,Here?,MALE
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,Yeah.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,You're saying someone framed him to find him.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,"Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?",MALE
BUCKY,I don't want to talk about it.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry.  We only have to talk about one.",MALE
CUSTODIAN,Hey. What is this?,MALE
DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER,I don't know.,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,"Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.",MALE
TONY STARK,"FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,"Sub-level 5, east wing.",FEMALE
BUCKY,What the hell is this?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home.  Longing.",MALE
BUCKY,No.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Rusted.,MALE
BUCKY,Stop.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Seventeen.,MALE
BUCKY,Stop.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Daybreak.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Furnace. Nine.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Benign.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Homecoming. One. Freight car.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Soldier?,MALE
BUCKY,Ready to comply.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Mission report. December 16, 1991.",MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Help me. Help.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Get up.  Who are you? What do you want?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,To see an empire fall.,MALE
MAN ON PA,The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.,MALE
SAM WILSON,Hey.,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,"Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Please tell me you brought a suit.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,Follow me.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're in position.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could at least recognize me.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Damn it.,MALE
ZEMO'S WIFE,"He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.",FEMALE
NEWS ANCHOR,"James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap!",MALE
BUCKY,Steve.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Which Bucky am I talking to?,MALE
BUCKY,Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Can't read that in a museum.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?",MALE
BUCKY,What did I do?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Enough.,MALE
BUCKY,"Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who was he?,MALE
BUCKY,I don't know.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than ""I don't know.""",MALE
BUCKY,He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why would he need to know that?,MALE
BUCKY,Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.,MALE
JOSEF,It hurts!,MALE
VASILY KARPOV,Good work.,MALE
VASILY KARPOV,Get me out of here.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who were they?,MALE
BUCKY,Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.,MALE
SAM WILSON,They all turn out like you?,MALE
BUCKY,Worse.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"The doctor, could he control them?",MALE
BUCKY,Enough.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Said he wanted to see an empire fall.,MALE
BUCKY,"With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.",MALE
SAM WILSON,This would have been a lot easier a week ago.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,If we call Tony . . .,MALE
SAM WILSON,"No, he won't believe us.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Even if he did . . .,MALE
SAM WILSON,Who knows if the Accords would let him help.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We're on our own.,MALE
SAM WILSON,Maybe not. I know a guy.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?,MALE
TONY STARK,We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?",FEMALE
SECRETARY ROSS,If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.,MALE
TONY STARK,"All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,How would that end any differently from the last time?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Thank you, sir.  My left arm is numb, is that normal?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You alright?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Always.  36 hours, jeez.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're seriously understaffed.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,No. You really think he'd be on our side?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,No.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I have an idea.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Me too. Where's yours?,MALE

PETER PARKER,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I approved, so now we're in business.",MALE
MAY PARKER,You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?,FEMALE

PETER PARKER,Yeah?,MALE
TONY STARK,It's pretty well funded.,MALE
PETER PARKER,Wow.,MALE
TONY STARK,Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?,MALE
MAY PARKER,Sure.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.  Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Uh, the garbage, actually.",MALE
TONY STARK,You're a dumpster diver.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.",MALE
TONY STARK,Ah-ah! Me first.,MALE
PETER PARKER,Okay.,MALE

PETER PARKER,S . . . Spider-Man.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Not in that onesie, you're not.",MALE
PETER PARKER,"It's not a onesie.  I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!",MALE
TONY STARK,Who else knows? Anybody?,MALE
PETER PARKER,Nobody.,MALE
TONY STARK,Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?,MALE
PETER PARKER,"No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.",MALE
TONY STARK,You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?,MALE
PETER PARKER,I did.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?",MALE
PETER PARKER,It's a long story. I was uh . . .,MALE
TONY STARK,Lordy! Can you even see in these?,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.",MALE
TONY STARK,"You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.  Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Because . . .  because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.",MALE
TONY STARK,Mm-Hmm.,MALE

TONY STARK,"Sure, because you're different.",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . .  and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.",MALE
TONY STARK,"So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?",MALE
PETER PARKER,Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.  You got a passport?",MALE

PETER PARKER,I can't go to Germany!,MALE
TONY STARK,Why?,MALE
PETER PARKER,I got . . . homework.,MALE
TONY STARK,I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.,MALE
PETER PARKER,I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!,MALE
TONY STARK,Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.,MALE
PETER PARKER,Don't tell Aunt May.,MALE

T'CHALA,As entertaining as that would be . . .,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You really think you can find him?,FEMALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know someone who does.,FEMALE
SHARON CARTER,Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's low profile.,MALE

T'CHALA,Captain.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Your highness.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You're after the wrong guy.,MALE
TONY STARK,Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!  Nice job, kid.",MALE

PETER PARKER,"Hey, everyone.",MALE
TONY STARK,. . . Good job.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You've been busy.,MALE
TONY STARK,"And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You did that when you signed.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite.  Come on.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Alright, Lang.",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, guys, something . . .",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Whoa. What--what the hell was that?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I believe this is yours, Captain America.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.",MALE
T'CHALA,Barnes is mine!,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?",MALE
TONY STARK,What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Okay, copy that!",MALE
T'CHALA,"Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Look, I really don't want to hurt you.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wouldn't stress about it.,FEMALE
BUCKY,What the hell is that?,MALE
SAM WILSON,Everyone's got a gimmick now.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!  You have the right to remain silent!",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You locked me in my room.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Hey, man.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss.",MALE
TONY STARK,First time for everything.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Made you look.,MALE
FRIDAY,Multiple contusions detected.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I detected that too.",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Oh god.  Hey buddy, I think you lost this!  Those wings carbon fiber?",MALE
SAM WILSON,Is this stuff coming out of you?,MALE
PETER PARKER,"That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.",MALE
SAM WILSON,I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Alright, sorry, my bad.  Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry.  Wwahhhh!",MALE
BUCKY,You couldn't have done that earlier?,MALE
SAM WILSON,I hate you.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Great.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hey, Cap, heads up!  Throw it at this. Now!",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Oh, come on!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Alright. Now, I'm pissed.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Is this, part of the plan?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,There's our ride.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come on!,MALE
VISION,Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now.,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.,MALE
PETER PARKER,Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.  He also said to go for your legs.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Clint, can you get him off me?",MALE

SCOTT LANG,Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa!,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"No, you get to the jet! Both of you!  The rest of us aren't getting out of here.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"This isn't the real fight, Steve.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Alright, Sam, what's the play?",MALE
SAM WILSON,"We need a diversion, something big.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.",MALE
BUCKY,He's gonna tear himself in half?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You're sure about this, Scott?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS!,MALE
PETER PARKER,Holy shit!,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I guess that's the signal.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Way to go, Tic Tac!",MALE
TONY STARK,Give me back my Rhodey.,MALE
PETER PARKER,I got him!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,We haven't met yet.  I'm Clint.,MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not gonna stop.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You know I can't.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm gonna regret this.  Go.,FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?",MALE
TONY STARK,"I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.",MALE
PETER PARKER,You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies?,MALE
TONY STARK,Maybe the kid's on to something.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"High now, Tony. Go high.",MALE
PETER PARKER,YES! Ha ha! That was awesome!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Does anyone have any orange slices?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Kid, you alright?",MALE
PETER PARKER,Hey! Get off me!,MALE
TONY STARK,Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Oh. Hey, man.",MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
PETER PARKER,That was scary.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. You're done. Alright?,MALE
PETER PARKER,What?,MALE
TONY STARK,You did a good job. Stay down.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"No, I'm good. I'm fine.",MALE
TONY STARK,Stay down.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"No, it's good I gotta get him back!",MALE
TONY STARK,You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . .  Okay, I'm done. I'm done.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.",FEMALE
VISION,I'm sorry.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Me, too.",FEMALE
VISION,It's as I said. Catastrophe.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Vision, I got a bandit on my six.  Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.",MALE
TONY STARK,Rhodey!,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Tony, I'm flying dead stick.",MALE
TONY STARK,RHODES!  Read vitals.,MALE
FRIDAY,Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.,MALE

HELMUT ZEMO,You know me so well.,MALE
GERMAN INNKEEPER,Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!,MALE
BUCKY,What's gonna happen to your friends?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.,MALE
BUCKY,"I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.,MALE
BUCKY,I know. But I did it.,MALE
TONY STARK,How did this happen?,MALE
VISION,I became distracted.,MALE
TONY STARK,I didn't think that was possible.,MALE
VISION,Neither did I.,MALE
TONY STARK,The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"You let them go, Nat.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We played this wrong.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm not the one that needs to watch their back.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"What am I looking at, Friday?",MALE
FRIDAY,Priority upload from Berlin police.,MALE
TONY STARK,Fire up the chopper.,MALE
FRIDAY,The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.,MALE
TONY STARK,Did you run facial recognition yet?,MALE
FRIDAY,What do I look like?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.",MALE
FRIDAY,You must be thinking of someone else.,MALE
TONY STARK,Must be.,MALE
FRIDAY,"The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence.  Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.",MALE
TONY STARK,"So, what happened to the real Broussard?",MALE
FRIDAY,He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.,MALE
TONY STARK,Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.,MALE
FRIDAY,"Yes, Boss.",MALE
GUARD,"This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.",MALE
TONY STARK,"So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Criminals?  Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for.  Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.",MALE
TONY STARK,Because you broke the law.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,I didn't make you.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"La, la, la, la, la . . .",MALE
TONY STARK,"You read it, you broke it.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"La, la, la, la la…",MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.",MALE
TONY STARK,Who are you?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Come on, man.",MALE
SAM WILSON,How's Rhodes?,MALE
TONY STARK,They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?,MALE
SAM WILSON,You're the good cop now?,MALE
TONY STARK,I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,What did you do? Get it back up!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.",MALE
SAM WILSON,That's a first.,MALE
TONY STARK,Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, it's alright.  Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.",MALE
TONY STARK,Easy.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?,MALE
BUCKY,Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.,MALE
BUCKY,What was her name again?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Dolores. You called her Doll.,MALE
BUCKY,She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"So are we, pal.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He can't have been here more than a few hours.,MALE
BUCKY,Long enough to wake them up.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You ready?,MALE
BUCKY,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,You seem a little defensive.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's been a long day.,MALE
TONY STARK,"At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then why are you here?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.  It's good to see you, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"You too, Cap.  Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . .",MALE
TONY STARK,I got heat signatures.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,How many?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, one.",MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.  Did you really think I wanted more of you?",MALE
BUCKY,What the hell?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.",MALE
TONY STARK,I'm betting I could beat that.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You lost someone?,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.,MALE
TONY STARK,I know that road. What is this?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Help my wife. Please. Help.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Sergeant Barnes?,MALE
MARIA STARK,Howard!,FEMALE
MARIA STARK,Howard!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Tony. Tony.,MALE
TONY STARK,Did you know?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I didn't know it was him.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yes.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Get out of here!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!",MALE
TONY STARK,Move!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It wasn't him!,MALE
FRIDAY,Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.,MALE
TONY STARK,Ah crap.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He's not going to stop. Go.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Come on, come on.",MALE
FRIDAY,"Targeting system's knackered, boss.",MALE
TONY STARK,I'm eyeballing it.  Do you even remember them?,MALE
BUCKY,I remember all of them.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,This isn't gonna change what happened.,MALE
TONY STARK,I don't care. He killed my mom.,MALE
ZEMO'S WIFE,"You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,I almost kill the wrong man.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Hardly an innocent one.,MALE
T'CHALA,This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,"My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, ""Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm."" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.",MALE
T'CHALA,Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them.  I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.,MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Tell that to the dead.,MALE
T'CHALA,The living are not done with you yet.,MALE
FRIDAY,You can't beat him hand to hand.,MALE
TONY STARK,Analyse his fight pattern.,MALE
FRIDAY,Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.,MALE
TONY STARK,Let's kick his ass.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He's my friend.,MALE
TONY STARK,So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I can do this all day.,MALE
TONY STARK,That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield!,MALE
EVERETT ROSS,"Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm?  So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?",MALE
HELMUT ZEMO,Did it?,MALE
TONY STARK,It's just the first pass.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You may wanna think about some AC down in . . .,MALE
TONY STARK,Let's go. I'll give you a hand.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think.",MALE
TONY STARK,You okay?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Oh yeah.,MALE
STAN LEE,"Are you Tony ""Stank""?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yes, this is--this is Tony ""Stank"". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. ""Stank"". Please, by the bathroom.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . .",MALE
FRIDAY,Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, put him through.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"Tony, we have a problem.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Ah, please hold.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,No. Don't . . .,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You sure about this?,MALE
BUCKY,"I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you for this.,MALE
T'CHALA,"Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.",MALE
T'CHALA,Let them try.,MALE
MAY PARKER,So. Who was it? Who hit you?,FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Some guy. So itchy, man. God.",MALE
MAY PARKER,"What's ""some guy's"" name?",FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Uh, Steve.",MALE
MAY PARKER,Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?,FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.  Ouch.",MALE
MAY PARKER,Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.,FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge.  That's way better. Thank you.",MALE
MAY PARKER,"Okay, tough guy.",FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?",MALE
