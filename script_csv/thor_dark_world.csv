0,ODIN,"Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.",MALE
1,ODIN,"Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.",MALE
2,ODIN,"The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.",MALE
3,KURSE,Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.,MALE
4,MALEKITH,Send the Kursed.,MALE
5,ODIN,"As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...",MALE
6,ODIN,"But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.",MALE
7,MALEKITH,Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.,MALE
8,ODIN,"Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.",MALE
9,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?",MALE
10,BOR,If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.,MALE
11,FRIGGA,Loki.,MALE
12,LOKI,"Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?",MALE
13,FRIGGA,"Please, don't make this worse.",MALE
14,LOKI,Define worse.,MALE
15,ODIN,Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.,MALE
16,LOKI,I really don't see what all the fuss is about.,MALE
17,ODIN,"Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.",MALE
18,LOKI,I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.,MALE
19,ODIN,"We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.",MALE
20,LOKI,Give or take 5000 years.,MALE
21,ODIN,All this because Loki desires a throne.,MALE
22,LOKI,It is my birthright.,MALE
23,ODIN,Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.,MALE
24,LOKI,"If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.",MALE
25,ODIN,Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.,MALE
26,LOKI,And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?,MALE
27,ODIN,"Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.",MALE
28,SIF,I've got this completely under control!,FEMALE
29,THOR,Is that why everything is on fire?,MALE
30,SIF,You're welcome.  All yours.,FEMALE

35,HOGUN,Where do we go next?,MALE
36,THOR,"Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.",MALE
37,HOGUN,You have my thanks.,MALE
38,THOR,"As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.",MALE
39,ODIN,Is Vanaheim secure?,MALE
40,THOR,As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.,MALE
41,ODIN,You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.,MALE
42,THOR,That was not my intent.,MALE
43,ODIN,"For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.",MALE
44,THOR,Thank you.,MALE
45,ODIN,Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.,MALE
46,THOR,"This isn't about JANE, Father.",MALE
47,ODIN,"Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you  I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.",MALE
48,SIF,There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.,FEMALE
49,THOR,I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.,MALE
50,SIF,"Well, the first was so much fun.",FEMALE
51,SIF,Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.,FEMALE
52,THOR,"No, this is one I set myself.",MALE
53,SIF,It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.,FEMALE
54,THOR,"I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.",MALE
55,RICHARD,Hi.,MALE
56,JANE,Hi.,FEMALE
57,RICHARD,So what's the story with you?,MALE
58,JANE,"Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.",FEMALE
59,RICHARD,"You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?",MALE
60,JANE,It's complicated.,FEMALE
61,RICHARD,Is he still around?,MALE
62,JANE,"No, he...went away.",FEMALE
63,RICHARD,"I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.",MALE
64,JANE,No!,FEMALE
65,RICHARD,"Oh, so many.",MALE

75,DARCY LEWIS,This is the reason we came all the way out here.,FEMALE
76,JANE,It's malfunctioning.,FEMALE
77,DARCY LEWIS,That's what I said.,FEMALE

79,JANE,I'm sure it's nothing.,FEMALE
80,RICHARD,Yeah.,MALE

105,STONEHENGE TV NEWS REPORTER,"I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.",MALE

127,NAVID,We just found it.,MALE
128,JANE,Can you show us?,FEMALE
129,DARCY LEWIS,That doesn't seem rigged.,FEMALE
130,DARCY LEWIS,Where did it go?,FEMALE
131,DARCY LEWIS,That's...that's incredible.,FEMALE
132,DARCY LEWIS,What happened?,FEMALE
133,MADDIE,"Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.",FEMALE

141,MALEKITH,The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.,MALE
142,HEIMDALL,You're late.,MALE
143,THOR,Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.,MALE
144,HEIMDALL,Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.,MALE
145,THOR,Perhaps. How fare the stars?,MALE
146,HEIMDALL,Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.,MALE
147,HEIMDALL,You recall what I told you of the Convergence?,MALE
148,THOR,"Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?",MALE
149,HEIMDALL,"The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.",MALE
150,THOR,I see nothing.,MALE
151,HEIMDALL,Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.,MALE
152,THOR,How is she?,MALE
153,HEIMDALL,"She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...",MALE
154,THOR,What?,MALE

162,DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE
163,JANE,"We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!",FEMALE
164,DARCY LEWIS,"Jane, you were gone for five hours!",FEMALE
165,JANE,What?,FEMALE
166,DARCY LEWIS,That's weird.  Typical.,FEMALE
167,THOR,Jane.,MALE
168,JANE,"Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.",FEMALE
169,THOR,"Well, I am. Jane...",MALE
170,JANE,Where were you?!,FEMALE
171,THOR,Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.,MALE
172,JANE,I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back,FEMALE
173,THOR,"I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.",MALE
174,JANE,"As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!",FEMALE
175,THOR,"Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool.  I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.",MALE
176,JANE,What?,FEMALE
177,THOR,I know...,MALE
178,JANE,You do?,FEMALE
179,THOR,Do what?,MALE
180,JANE,Hey! Is that you?,FEMALE
181,JANE,Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.,FEMALE
182,DARCY LEWIS,Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.,FEMALE
183,JANE,Hold that thought.,FEMALE
184,DARCY LEWIS,"Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?",FEMALE
185,THOR,Space is fine.,MALE
186,JANE,Excuse me?,FEMALE
187,POLICE OFFICER #1,Are you Jane Foster?,MALE
188,JANE,Yes.,FEMALE
189,POLICE OFFICER #1,Do you know this man?,MALE
190,JANE,He's my intern. My intern's intern.,FEMALE
191,POLICE OFFICER #1,"This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me.",MALE
192,THOR,Jane! Jane?  You alright?,MALE
193,JANE,What just happened?,FEMALE
194,POLICE OFFICER #2,"Place your hands on your head, step back!",MALE
195,THOR,The woman is unwell.,MALE
196,POLICE OFFICER #2,She's dangerous.,MALE
197,THOR,So am I.,MALE
198,POLICE OFFICER #2,Requesting armed response officers to the scene.,MALE
199,THOR,Hold on to me.,MALE
200,JANE,What are you doing?,FEMALE
201,DARCY LEWIS,Holy shit!,FEMALE
202,JANE,We have to do that again.  Hi.,FEMALE
203,HEIMDALL,Welcome to Asgard.,MALE
204,MALEKITH,"Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light.",MALE
205,KURSE,Our survival will be your legacy.,MALE
206,MALEKITH,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world.,MALE
207,JANE,What's that?,FEMALE
208,EIR,Be still.,FEMALE
209,THOR,"This is not of Earth, what is it?",MALE
210,ASGARDIAN NURSE,"We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.",FEMALE
211,JANE,"That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?",FEMALE
212,EIR,It's a Soul Forge.,FEMALE
213,JANE,Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?,FEMALE
214,EIR,Yes.,FEMALE
215,JANE,It's a quantum field generator.,FEMALE
216,ODIN,My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?,MALE
217,THOR,She's ill.,MALE
218,ODIN,She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.,MALE
219,THOR,I brought here because we can help her.,MALE
220,ODIN,She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table.,MALE
221,JANE,Did he just...?  Who do you think you are?,FEMALE
222,ODIN,I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.,MALE
223,JANE,"Oh. Well, I'm...",FEMALE
224,ODIN,"I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.",MALE
225,JANE,You told your Dad about me?,FEMALE
226,THOR,"Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.",MALE
227,ODIN,"Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard.",MALE
228,THOR,"Don't touch her.  Jane, are you alright?",MALE
229,ODIN,That's impossible.,MALE
230,EIR,"The infection, it's defending her.",FEMALE
231,THOR,"No, it's defending itself.",MALE
232,ODIN,"Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.  But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.",MALE
233,THOR,"""Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."" They were these stories mother told us as children.",MALE
234,ODIN,"Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.",MALE
235,JANE,What happened?,FEMALE
236,ODIN,He killed them all.,MALE
237,THOR,Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.,MALE
238,ODIN,The Dark Elves are dead.,MALE
239,JANE,Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?,FEMALE
240,ODIN,"No, it does not.",MALE
241,MALEKITH,The Realms will be aligned soon.,MALE
242,MALEKITH,You'll be the last of the Kursed.,MALE
243,KURSE,Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.,MALE
244,MALEKITH,"You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you.  And then no power of our enemies will stop me.",MALE
245,KURSE,I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe.,MALE
246,LOKI,Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.,MALE
247,FRIGGA,"The books I sent, do they not interest you?",MALE
248,LOKI,"Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?",MALE
249,FRIGGA,"I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.",MALE
250,LOKI,Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.,MALE
251,FRIGGA,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,MALE
252,LOKI,"My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.",MALE
253,FRIGGA,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,MALE
254,LOKI,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,MALE
255,FRIGGA,Your father...,MALE
256,LOKI,He's not my father!,MALE
257,FRIGGA,Then am I not your mother?,MALE
258,LOKI,You're not.,MALE
259,FRIGGA,Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.,MALE
260,JANE,"When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.",FEMALE
261,THOR,"Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.",MALE
262,JANE,"Well, how's that possible?",FEMALE
263,THOR,"I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence.  During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost.",MALE
264,JANE,I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?,FEMALE
265,THOR,"I'll find a way to save you, Jane.",MALE
266,JANE,Your father said there was...,FEMALE
267,THOR,My father doesn't know everything.,MALE
268,FRIGGA,Don't let him hear you say that.,MALE
269,THOR,"JANE, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother.",MALE
270,JANE,Hi.,FEMALE
271,LOKI,You might want to take the stairs to the left.,MALE
272,FRIGGA,The prisons.,MALE
273,THOR,Loki.,MALE
274,FRIGGA,"Go, I will look after her.",MALE
275,FANDRAL,It's as if they resent being imprisoned.,MALE
276,VOLSTAGG,There's no pleasing some creatures.,MALE
277,THOR,"Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word.  Very well, you don't have my word.",MALE
278,ODIN,"Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.",MALE
279,FRIGGA,Odin.,MALE
280,ODIN,"Frigga.  Go!  It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.",MALE
281,FRIGGA,You've never been a very good liar.,MALE
282,ODIN,"Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.",MALE
283,FRIGGA,You take care.,MALE
284,ODIN,"Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.",MALE
285,FRIGGA,"It's only because I worry over you that you have survived.  Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.",MALE
286,JANE,"Yes, ma'am.",FEMALE
287,ODIN,Frigga.,MALE
288,FRIGGA,"Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.",MALE
289,MALEKITH,"I have survived worse, woman.",MALE
290,FRIGGA,Who are you?,MALE
291,MALEKITH,"I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine.  You have taken something, child. Give it back.  Witch! Where is the Aether?",MALE
292,FRIGGA,I'll never tell.,MALE
293,MALEKITH,I believe you.,MALE
294,SELVIG,"The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align.  Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and...  Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other.  But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic.  My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.  This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions?",FEMALE
295,PATIENT,Yeah. Can I have my shoe back?,MALE
296,KURSE,"I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.",MALE
297,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,Jane Foster. You need to come with us.,MALE
298,FANDRAL,"We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless.",MALE
299,THOR,She's your prisoner now?  Leave us.,MALE
300,ODIN,I do not wish to fight with you.,MALE
301,THOR,"Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.",MALE
302,ODIN,"We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.",MALE
303,THOR,"Yes, and you will destroy us.",MALE
304,ODIN,You overestimate the power of these creatures.,MALE
305,THOR,"No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.",MALE
306,ODIN,"If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.",MALE
307,THOR,The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.,MALE
308,ODIN,"If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.",MALE
309,THOR,And how of our men shall fall on theirs?,MALE
310,ODIN,"As many as are needed!  We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.",MALE
311,THOR,And how are you different from Malekith?,MALE
312,ODIN,"The difference, my son, is that I will win.",MALE
313,DARCY LEWIS,Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!,FEMALE
314,IAN BOOTHBY,What's SHIELD?,MALE
315,DARCY LEWIS,"It's a secret.  Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.",FEMALE
316,NEWS REPORTER,"Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, SELVIG, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.",MALE
317,IAN BOOTHBY,"Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again?",MALE
318,NEWS REPORTER,...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm...,MALE
319,THOR,You're not in Odin's war council?,MALE
320,HEIMDALL,The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go.  We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that?,MALE
321,THOR,"Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.",MALE
322,HEIMDALL,"I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.",MALE
323,THOR,"I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.",MALE
324,HEIMDALL,As are we all.,MALE
325,THOR,Well I see clearly enough.,MALE
326,HEIMDALL,The risks are too great.,MALE
327,THOR,"Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way.",MALE
328,HEIMDALL,What do you require of me?,MALE
329,THOR,"What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard.  We must move Jane off world.",MALE
330,SIF,The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.,FEMALE
331,HEIMDALL,"There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.",MALE
332,THOR,"One, actually.",MALE
333,VOLSTAGG,No.,MALE
334,LOKI,"Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?",MALE
335,THOR,"Loki, enough. No more illusions.",MALE
336,LOKI,"Now you see me, brother.  Did she suffer?",MALE
337,THOR,I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.,MALE
338,LOKI,Go on.,MALE
339,THOR,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell.",MALE
340,LOKI,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,MALE
341,THOR,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you.",MALE
342,LOKI,Hmm. When do we start?,MALE
343,FANDRAL,He will betray you.,MALE
344,THOR,He will try.,MALE
345,LOKI,"This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?",MALE
346,THOR,If you keep speaking I just might.,MALE
347,LOKI,Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here.  Is this better?,MALE
348,LOKI,"Still, we could be less conspicuous.  Hm, brother. You look ravishing.",MALE
349,THOR,It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.,MALE
350,LOKI,"Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much.  Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer–  What?  You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something!  At last, a little common sense.",MALE
351,THOR,And I thought you liked tricks.,MALE
352,FANDRAL,"Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.",MALE
353,THOR,I won't be the one who comes for her.,MALE
354,JANE,I'm not hungry.,FEMALE
355,SIF,"Good, let's go.",FEMALE
356,JANE,You're...,FEMALE
357,LOKI,I'm Loki. You may have heard of...,MALE
358,JANE,That was for New York.,FEMALE
359,LOKI,I like her.,MALE
360,SIF,And what of the All-Father?,FEMALE
361,HEIMDALL,It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.,MALE
362,ODIN,You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?,MALE
363,HEIMDALL,"Treason, my lord.",MALE
364,ODIN,Whose?,MALE
365,HEIMDALL,Mine.,MALE
366,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"My King, the mortal has been taken.",MALE
367,ODIN,"Stop Thor, by any means necessary.",MALE
368,GUARDS,There they are! Take them. On my command.,MALE
369,SIF,I'll hold them off. Take her.,FEMALE
370,THOR,Thank you.,MALE
371,SIF,Betray him and I'll kill you.,FEMALE
372,LOKI,"It's good to see you too, Sif.",MALE
373,VOLSTAGG,"Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.",MALE
374,THOR,"That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot.",MALE
375,VOLSTAGG,I will give you as much time as I can.,MALE
376,THOR,"Thank you, my friend.",MALE
377,VOLSTAGG,If you even think about betraying him...,MALE
378,LOKI,You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line.   I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.,MALE
379,THOR,"I said, ""how hard could it be?""",MALE
380,GUARD,They're on the ship!,MALE
381,LOKI,"They're on the ship!  Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.",MALE
382,THOR,"Shut up, Loki.",MALE
383,LOKI,You must have missed something.,MALE
384,THOR,"No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.",MALE
385,LOKI,"No, don't hit it, just press it gently.",MALE
386,THOR,I am pressing it gently. It's not working!,MALE
387,GUARDS,Get him! Get him!,MALE
388,LOKI,I think you missed a column.,MALE
389,THOR,Shut up!,MALE
390,LOKI,"Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.",MALE
391,THOR,"Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly?",MALE
392,LOKI,"Oh, dear. Is she dead?",MALE
393,THOR,Jane.,MALE
394,JANE,I'm okay.,FEMALE
395,THOR,Not a word.,MALE
396,LOKI,Now they're following us.  Now they're firing at us!,MALE
397,THOR,"Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting!",MALE
398,LOKI,"Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather.  You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!",MALE
399,FANDRAL,"I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki.",MALE
400,LOKI,You lied to me. I'm impressed.,MALE
401,THOR,"I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway.  Fandral.",MALE
402,FANDRAL,"Right.  For Asgard.  Nothing personal, boys!",MALE
403,THOR,Loki!,MALE
404,LOKI,If it were easy everyone would do it.,MALE
405,THOR,Are you mad?,MALE
406,LOKI,Possibly.  Ta-da!,MALE
407,KURSE,We must attack now.,MALE
408,MALEKITH,No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home.,MALE
409,LOKI,What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.,MALE
410,THOR,It would consume you.,MALE
411,LOKI,"She's holding up alright, for now.",MALE
412,THOR,She's strong in ways you'd never even know.,MALE
413,LOKI,Say goodbye.,MALE
414,THOR,Not this day.,MALE
415,LOKI,"This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.",MALE
416,THOR,And will that satisfy you?,MALE
417,LOKI,Satisfaction is not in my nature.,MALE
418,THOR,Surrender not in mine.,MALE
419,LOKI,The son of Odin.,MALE
420,THOR,"No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!",MALE
421,LOKI,Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!,MALE
422,THOR,What help were you in your cell?,MALE
423,LOKI,Who put me there? Who put me there?!,MALE
424,THOR,You know damn well! You know damn well who!  She wouldn't want us to fight.,MALE
425,LOKI,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.",MALE
426,THOR,I wish I could trust you.,MALE
427,LOKI,Trust my rage.,MALE
428,DESK OFFICER,"You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.",MALE
429,IAN BOOTHBY,"What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.",MALE
430,DESK OFFICER,"One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine.  Various.",MALE
431,DARCY LEWIS,Erik.,FEMALE
432,DESK OFFICER,And...  These.,MALE
433,IAN BOOTHBY,"Yeah, those. Thank goodness.",MALE
434,DARCY LEWIS,Erik.,FEMALE
435,SELVIG,Yes?,FEMALE
436,DARCY LEWIS,It's uh...Darcy.,FEMALE
437,SELVIG,Darcy.  It's so good to see you.,FEMALE
438,DARCY LEWIS,Uh...I missed you too.,FEMALE
439,SELVIG,How did you find me?,FEMALE
440,IAN BOOTHBY,You were naked on TV.,MALE
441,DARCY LEWIS,"Okay, time to go. Lots to do.  Getting weird now.  I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period.",FEMALE
442,IAN BOOTHBY,I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either.  Are you alright?,MALE
443,SELVIG,I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it.,FEMALE
444,IAN BOOTHBY,"Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.",MALE
445,SELVIG,"It's happening, sooner than I calculated.",FEMALE
446,DARCY LEWIS,"Wait, what's happening?  Birds? Birds are happening?",FEMALE
447,IAN BOOTHBY,"They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.",MALE
448,DARCY LEWIS,Erik?,FEMALE
449,SELVIG,Look.,FEMALE
450,DARCY LEWIS,Where did they go?  What the hell was that?!  Why are you smiling?,FEMALE
451,SELVIG,There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.  Take me to Jane's lab!,FEMALE
452,THOR,Jane.,MALE
453,JANE,Malekith.,FEMALE
454,THOR,"Alright, are you ready?",MALE
455,LOKI,I am.  You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.,MALE
456,THOR,"Yeah, possibly.",MALE
457,LOKI,"You still don't trust me, brother?",MALE
458,THOR,Would you?,MALE
459,LOKI,"No, I wouldn't.",MALE
460,JANE,Thor! No!,FEMALE
461,LOKI,"You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you?  All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet!  Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift!  I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.",MALE
462,KURSE,"He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell.",MALE
463,MALEKITH,Look at me.,MALE
464,THOR,"Loki, now!   No!",MALE
465,LOKI,"See you in hell, monster!",MALE
466,THOR,"No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!",MALE
467,LOKI,I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool!,MALE
468,THOR,"Stay with me, okay?",MALE
469,LOKI,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,MALE
470,THOR,Shh.,MALE
471,LOKI,I'm sorry.,MALE
472,THOR,It's okay.  It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.,MALE
473,LOKI,I didn't do it for him.,MALE
474,THOR,No!,MALE
475,JANE,"He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.",FEMALE
476,THOR,"How? Jane, how?",MALE
477,JANE,I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?,FEMALE
478,THOR,The Convergence.,MALE
479,JANE,"Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.",FEMALE
480,THOR,Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.,MALE
481,JANE,I only found it because I was looking for you.,FEMALE
482,THOR,Jane.,MALE
483,JANE,Now we're trapped here.,FEMALE
484,THOR,It's not me.,MALE
485,JANE,Hello?,FEMALE
486,RICHARD,"Hi, Jane, it's Richard.",MALE
487,JANE,Richard?! Where are you?,FEMALE
488,RICHARD,I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today.,MALE
489,JANE,"Oh, my God! This is amazing.",FEMALE
490,RICHARD,Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.,MALE
491,JANE,How am I getting service here?,FEMALE
492,RICHARD,Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?,MALE
493,JANE,"No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.",FEMALE
494,RICHARD,Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.,MALE
495,JANE,"Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?",FEMALE
496,RICHARD,"Yeah, I will.",MALE
497,JANE,"Oh, my God.",FEMALE
498,RICHARD,Am I interrupting something.,MALE
499,JANE,"No, no, no, nothing at all.  Come on.",FEMALE
500,RICHARD,"I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel?",MALE
501,THOR,Where are we going?,MALE
502,RICHARD,Hello?,MALE
503,THOR,Why are there so many shoes in here?,MALE
504,RICHARD,I'll just text her.,MALE
505,DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE
506,JANE,Hey.,FEMALE
507,DARCY LEWIS,"You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy!  All the stuff we saw is spreading.  Did you go to a party?",FEMALE
508,JANE,Erik?!,FEMALE
509,SELVIG,"Jane, how wonderful!  You've been to Asgard.",FEMALE
510,JANE,Where are your pants?,FEMALE
511,IAN BOOTHBY,"Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.",MALE
512,JANE,"Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.",FEMALE
513,SELVIG,Okay.,FEMALE
514,THOR,"Are you well, Erik?",MALE
515,SELVIG,"Your brother is not coming, is he?",FEMALE
516,THOR,Loki is dead.,MALE
517,SELVIG,"Oh, thank God.  I...I'm so sorry.",FEMALE
518,THOR,Thank you.,MALE
519,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.",MALE
520,ODIN,Thor?,MALE
521,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...",MALE
522,ODIN,What?,MALE
523,ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,We found a body.,MALE
524,ODIN,Loki.,MALE
525,JANE,Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.,FEMALE
526,SELVIG,"Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.",FEMALE
527,THOR,"Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.",MALE
528,DARCY LEWIS,"Well, how do we know where that is?",FEMALE
529,SELVIG,"We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it.  All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map.  Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here.",FEMALE
530,IAN BOOTHBY,Greenwich?,MALE
531,JANE,"The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart.",FEMALE
532,SELVIG,I better get my pants.,FEMALE
533,DARCY LEWIS,"Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.",FEMALE
534,IAN BOOTHBY,They're taped together!,MALE
535,DARCY LEWIS,Do you even know what these things do?,FEMALE
536,IAN BOOTHBY,No.,MALE
537,DARCY LEWIS,"Neither do I.  Come on, come on!",FEMALE
538,IAN BOOTHBY,Fine!,MALE
539,DARCY LEWIS,Holy shit!,FEMALE
540,MALEKITH,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.",MALE
541,THOR,Not by your hand!,MALE
542,MALEKITH,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished.,MALE
543,SELVIG,We're running out of time.,FEMALE
544,JANE,Almost there.,FEMALE
545,SELVIG,"Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.",FEMALE
546,JANE,"Oh, come on.  Come on, Darcy.",FEMALE
547,THOR,"You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder.",MALE
548,IAN BOOTHBY,Done.,MALE
549,SELVIG,The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.,FEMALE
550,JANE,"That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.  Okay, you might wanna hold on to something.",FEMALE
551,DARCY LEWIS,That is awesome! How did you do that?,FEMALE
552,JANE,"Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...",FEMALE
553,DARCY LEWIS,"Oh, there's a guy with a sword!",FEMALE
554,JANE,Oops.,FEMALE
555,SELVIG,Let's go.,FEMALE
556,DARCY LEWIS,What the hell just happened?  Move!,FEMALE
557,JANE,What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!,FEMALE
558,STUDENT,"You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything!",FEMALE
559,CONTROL,Confirming ship is hostile.,NEUTRAL
560,PILOT,"Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.",MALE
561,CONTROL,Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way.  Missile off target! I repeat...,NEUTRAL
562,PILOT,Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control!,MALE
563,SELVIG,What are you doing?,FEMALE
564,JANE,My signal's lost connection.,FEMALE
565,SELVIG,Jane! Come on!,FEMALE
566,IAN BOOTHBY,Are you alright?,MALE
567,DARCY LEWIS,You saved my life.,FEMALE
568,IAN BOOTHBY,"Yeah. Yes, I did.",MALE
569,JANE,Darcy?,FEMALE
570,DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE

575,THOR,How do I get to Greenwich?,MALE
576,WOMAN ON TRAIN,"Take this train, three stops.",FEMALE
577,MAN,Mind the gap.,MALE
578,WOMAN ON TRAIN,Sorry. Sorry.,FEMALE
579,JANE,We're out of time.,FEMALE
580,SELVIG,Jane. Jane!,FEMALE
581,JANE,Thor! We're too late.,FEMALE
582,SELVIG,The Convergence is at its peak.,FEMALE
583,THOR,Can those things stop him?,MALE
584,SELVIG,Not from here.,FEMALE
585,JANE,We can't get close enough.,FEMALE
586,THOR,I can.   Malekith!,MALE
587,MALEKITH,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",MALE
588,THOR,I've come to accept your surrender.,MALE
589,MALEKITH,You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.,MALE
590,THOR,But you can.,MALE
591,JANE,Thor! No!,FEMALE
592,SELVIG,Jane!  Everybody okay?,FEMALE
593,DARCY LEWIS,"He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.",FEMALE
594,JANE,"Well, it's only been two days, so...",FEMALE
595,SELVIG,Did he say anything before he left?,FEMALE
596,JANE,"Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out.",FEMALE
597,SELVIG,Oh.,FEMALE
598,ODIN,You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?,MALE
599,THOR,"My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.",MALE
600,ODIN,"Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?",MALE
601,THOR,"When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice?  This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.",MALE
602,ODIN,"One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",MALE
603,THOR,"Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough?",MALE
604,ODIN,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",MALE
605,THOR,I shall try to be.,MALE
606,ODIN,"I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",MALE
607,THOR,I know.,MALE
608,ODIN,"If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.",MALE
609,THOR,"Thank you, father.",MALE
610,LOKI,No. Thank you.,MALE
611,COLLECTOR'S ASSISTANT,"I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.",MALE
612,THE COLLECTOR,"Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor.",MALE
613,SIF,You know why we're here.,FEMALE
614,THE COLLECTOR,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?",MALE
615,VOLSTAGG,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,MALE
616,THE COLLECTOR,That's very wise.  I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.,MALE
617,SIF,See that it is.,FEMALE
618,THE COLLECTOR,"One down, five to go.",MALE
619,SIF,I've got this completely under control!,FEMALE
620,THOR,Is that why everything's on fire?,MALE
621,SIF,All yours.,FEMALE
622,THOR,Hello.  I accept your surrender.,MALE
623,THOR,Anyone else?,MALE
624,LOKI,I really don't see what all the fuss is about…,MALE
625,ODIN,"Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!",MALE
626,LOKI,"I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.",MALE
627,ODIN,"We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.",MALE
628,LOKI,Give or take five thousand years.,MALE
629,ODIN,All this because Loki desires a throne...,MALE
630,LOKI,It is my birthright!,MALE
631,ODIN,"Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.",MALE
632,LOKI,"If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.",MALE
633,ODIN,"Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.",MALE
634,LOKI,And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?,MALE
635,ODIN,"Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.",MALE
636,DARCY,"Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.",MALE
637,IAN BOOTHBY,"Ian, my name's Ian.",MALE
638,DARCY,Do you want the phase meter?,MALE
639,JANE,No.,FEMALE
640,DARCY,Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.,MALE
641,IAN BOOTHBY,Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.,MALE
642,THOR,Jane?,MALE
643,JANE,Sorry. I just…needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.,FEMALE
644,THOR,I am. Jane—,MALE
645,JANE,Where were you?!,FEMALE
646,THOR,Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.,MALE
647,JANE,"I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.",FEMALE
648,THOR,"I know. I know, but the Bifröst was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging…I had to put an end to the slaughter.",MALE
649,JANE,"As excuses go, it's not…terrible…But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!",FEMALE
650,THOR,"Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.",MALE
651,MALEKITH,"Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.",MALE
652,KURSE,Our survival will be your legacy.,MALE
653,MALEKITH,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.,MALE
654,ODIN,She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!,MALE
655,JANE,Did he just-? Who do you think you are?,FEMALE
656,ODIN,I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.,MALE
657,JANE,Oh. Well I'm-,FEMALE
658,ODIN,"I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.",MALE
659,JANE,You told your dad about me?,FEMALE
660,FRIGGA,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,MALE
661,LOKI,My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life…that I was born to be a king.,MALE
662,FRIGGA,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,MALE
663,LOKI,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,MALE
664,FRIGGA,Your father—,MALE
665,LOKI,He's not my father!,MALE
666,FRIGGA,Then am I not your mother?,MALE
667,LOKI,You're not.,MALE
668,FRIGGA,You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.,MALE
669,FRIGGA,"Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.",MALE
670,MALEKITH,"I have survived worse, woman.",MALE
671,FRIGGA,Who are you?,MALE
672,MALEKITH,"I am Malekith...  and I would have what is mine.  You have taken something, child. Give it back.  WITCH! Where is the Aether?!",MALE
673,FRIGGA,I'll never tell you.,MALE
674,MALEKITH,I believe you.,MALE
675,LOKI,Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?,MALE
676,THOR,"Loki, enough. No more illusions.",MALE
677,LOKI,"Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?",MALE
678,THOR,"I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.",MALE
679,LOKI,Go on.,MALE
680,THOR,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.",MALE
681,LOKI,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,MALE
682,THOR,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.",MALE
683,LOKI,Hm. When do we start?,MALE
684,JANE,You're…,FEMALE
685,LOKI,I'm Loki. You may have heard—,MALE
686,JANE,That was for New York!,FEMALE
687,LOKI,I like her.,MALE
688,SIF,"Betray him, and I'll kill you.",FEMALE
689,LOKI,"Good to see you too, Sif.",MALE
690,VOLSTAGG,If you even think about betraying him…,MALE
691,LOKI,"You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.",MALE
692,LOKI,"You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant-",MALE
693,FANDRAL,"I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!",MALE
694,LOKI,You lied to me. I'm impressed.,MALE
695,LOKI,"If it were easy, everyone would do it.",MALE
696,THOR,Are you mad?,MALE
697,LOKI,Possibly.,MALE
698,THOR,"You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!",MALE
699,LOKI,"Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!",MALE
700,THOR,What good were you in your cell?,MALE
701,LOKI,Who put me there? Who put me there?!,MALE
702,THOR,You know damn well! You know damn well who!  She wouldn't want us to fight.,MALE
703,LOKI,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.",MALE
704,THOR,I wish I could trust you.,MALE
705,LOKI,Trust my rage.,MALE
706,THOR,I will tell Father what you did here today.,MALE
707,LOKI,I didn't do it for him.,MALE
708,DARCY,What the hell was that?  Why are you smiling?,MALE
709,SELVIG,There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.,FEMALE
710,MALEKITH,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.",MALE
711,THOR,Not by your hand!,MALE
712,MALEKITH,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!,MALE
713,MALEKITH,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",MALE
714,THOR,I've come to accept your surrender.,MALE
715,MALEKITH,You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!,MALE
716,THOR,But you can.,MALE
717,ODIN,"One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",MALE
718,THOR,Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough?,MALE
719,ODIN,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",MALE
720,THOR,I shall try to be.,MALE
721,ODIN,"I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",MALE
722,THOR,I know.,MALE
723,ODIN,"If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.",MALE
724,THOR,"Thank you, Father.",MALE
725,LOKI,No... thank you.,MALE
726,CARINA,I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.,FEMALE
727,THE COLLECTOR,Asgardians! It's an honor.,MALE
728,SIF,You know why we're here.,FEMALE
729,THE COLLECTOR,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?",MALE
730,VOLSTAGG,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,MALE
731,THE COLLECTOR,"That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.",MALE
732,SIF,See that it is.,FEMALE
733,THE COLLECTOR,One down…five to go.,MALE
