FATHER,"Millions of years ago, a meteorite made of vibranium, the strongest substance in the universe struck the continent of Africa affecting the plant life around it.",MALE
FATHER,"And when the time of man came, five tribes settled on it and called it Wakanda. The tribes lived in constant war with each other until a warrior shaman received a vision from the Panther goddess Bast who led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a plant that granted him super human strength, speed, and instincts.",MALE

T'CHALA,"Never.  Tell me how to best protect Wakanda. I want to be a great King, Baba. Just like you.",MALE

T'CHALA,What would you have Wakanda do about it?,MALE
NAKIA,"Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it... other countries do it, we do it better.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life.",MALE

W'KABI,More like what?,MALE
T'CHALA,Foreign aid... refugee programs.,MALE
W'KABI,"You let refugees in, they bring their problems with them. And then Wakanda is like everywhere else.",MALE
W'KABI,"Now, if you said you wanted me and my men to go out there and clean up the world, then I'd be all for it.",MALE

W'KABI,"Bast, are we in trouble?",MALE
OKOYE,My King. My love. You will never guess who just popped up on our radar.,FEMALE
OKOYE,A misidentified Wakandan artifact was stolen yesterday from a British museum. We have learned Ulysses Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn to an American buyer in South Korea tomorrow night.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret. I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial.,MALE
MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER,Wakanda does not need a warrior right now. We need a King.,MALE
W'KABI,"My parents were killed when he attacked. Not a day goes by when I do not think about what Klaue took from us, from me.",MALE
OKOYE,It's too great an opportunity to pass.,FEMALE
W'KABI,"Take me with you. We'll take him down together side by side, eh?",MALE
T'CHALA,I need you here protecting the border.,MALE

T'CHALA,You have my word I will bring him back.  We will proceed with the mission.,MALE
SHURI,"My, King.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,Stop it. Stop it.,MALE
SHURI,I've already sent a car ahead to Busan for you.  Who are you taking with you to Korea?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Okoye. And Nakia as well.,MALE
SHURI,You sure it's a good idea to take your ex on a mission?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"Yes. We'll be fine.  Besides, you will be on call, should we need backup.",MALE
SHURI,"I have great things to show you, brother. Here are your communication devices for Korea. Unlimited range, also equipped with audio surveillance system.",FEMALE
SHURI,Check these out. Remote access Kimoyo beads. Updated to interface directly with my sand table.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,And what are these?,MALE
SHURI,The real question is what are those? Why do you have your toes out in my lab?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"What, you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day.",MALE
SHURI,Yea I bet the elders loved that. Try them on.,FEMALE
SHURI,"Fully automated, like the old American movie Baba used to watch. And I made them completely sound absorbent.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,Interesting…,MALE
SHURI,Guess what I call them.,FEMALE
SHURI,Sneakers...,FEMALE
SHURI,Because you... never mind.,FEMALE
SHURI,If you're going to take on Klaue you'll need the best the Design Group has to offer.,FEMALE
SHURI,Exhibit A. Old tech.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Old...,MALE
SHURI,"Functional, but old. Eh, people are shooting at me... wait let me put on my helmet...",FEMALE
T'CHALA,Enough...,MALE
SHURI,Now look at these.,FEMALE
SHURI,Do you like that one?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Tempting. But the idea is to not be noticed. This one.,MALE
SHURI,Now tell it to go on.,FEMALE
SHURI,Oooh!! The entire suit sits within the teeth of the necklace. Strike it.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Anywhere?,MALE
SHURI,Mhm.,FEMALE
SHURI,"Not that hard, genius!",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard.",MALE
SHURI,"I invite you to my lab, and you just kick things around.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"Well maybe you should make it a little stronger, eh?",MALE
T'CHALA,Wait a minute.,MALE
SHURI,The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribution.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Very nice.,MALE
SHURI,"Now strike it again, in the same spot.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,You are recording?,MALE
SHURI,For research purposes...,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Delete that footage...,MALE
NAKIA,This way.,FEMALE
OKOYE,"Bast willing this goes quickly, and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head.",FEMALE
NAKIA,It looks nice. Just whip it back and forth.,FEMALE
OKOYE,What? It's a disgrace.,FEMALE
NAKIA,"Hello Sophia, good to see you.",FEMALE
ELDERLY WOMAN,Who are these two?,FEMALE
NAKIA,My friends from Kenya. Very deep pockets. They're good.,FEMALE
ELDERLY WOMAN,"Good for trouble, like you?",FEMALE
NAKIA,Thank you.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Spread out. The buyer is likely already here.,MALE
T'CHALA,The woman outside -- what trouble was she referring to?,MALE
NAKIA,"Ah, I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders. Made a bit of a mess.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan heiress?",MALE
NAKIA,Depends on how quickly we finish the mission...,FEMALE
OKOYE,Can we please focus.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Thank you.,FEMALE
NAKIA,"Over here. One whiskey, please.",FEMALE
NAKIA,Eyes up. Americans. I count... three.,FEMALE
OKOYE,"Five. How could you miss ""Greased Lightning"" there behind you.",FEMALE

T'CHALA,Agent Ross.,MALE
ROSS,Your highness.,MALE
T'CHALA,You are buying from Klaue...,MALE
ROSS,"What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to, do me a favor and stay out of my way.",MALE
T'CHALA,I gave you Zemo.,MALE
ROSS,And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I'd say we were even.,MALE
ROSS,"You really need to leave, now.",MALE
T'CHALA,Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned.,MALE
ROSS,"Hey, you won.",MALE
STAN LEE,"You know what, I think I'll just take these, bring 'em over here and hold on for safe keeping.",MALE
ROSS,"Ok heads up, the King of Wakanda is here. He cannot leave with Klaue.",MALE
ROSS,"Alright, vibranium from the attack on Sokovia links back to a person that I'm not actually saying I'm here to make a deal with but that deal will not be called off. When the dust settles you and I can work something out.",MALE
T'CHALA,I am not here to make a deal.,MALE
NAKIA,Klaue plus 8!,FEMALE
T'CHALA,General.,MALE
OKOYE,In position to secure our exit.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,And the vibranium.,MALE

KLAUE,Yea I'll send you the soundcloud link if you like.,MALE
KLAUE,"Aye, Dave. Get him the link to the tape.",MALE

KLAUE,"Oh, you think they're for you?",MALE
KLAUE,"Don't worry. I can do a deal with you all by myself, thank you very much.",MALE
NAKIA,"Six more, it's a set up.",FEMALE
KLAUE,You got the diamonds?,MALE
ROSS,"Ok, that's enough.",MALE
NAKIA,We need to move on Klaue.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Stand down. We can't afford a shoot- out.,MALE
ROSS,The vibranium?,MALE
KLAUE,"I was going to buy a fancy suitcase, but I thought I'd save myself some money.",MALE
NAKIA,It's now or never.,FEMALE
OKOYE,STAND DOWN!,FEMALE

OKOYE,We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here.,MALE
T'CHALA,"After your questioning, we will to take him back to Wakanda with us.",MALE
ROSS,"What? No. Look I like you, a lot. But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere. Listen, I 'm doing you a favor by letting you even be in here.",MALE

ROSS,"I don't trust anybody, not in this job. But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there. Where'd you get that?",MALE
KLAUE,It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like.,MALE
ROSS,Why don't you give me the name of your supplier and I'll ask them.,MALE
KLAUE,"He's right outside, why don't you ask him yourself?",MALE
ROSS,T'Challa? You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?,MALE
KLAUE,Bingo.,MALE
KLAUE,What do you actually know about Wakanda?,MALE
ROSS,Shepherds. Textiles. Cool outfits.,MALE
KLAUE,"It's all a front. Explorers searched for it for centuries. El Dorado: The Golden City. They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it. The gift. Vibranium...",MALE
ROSS,Vibranium yea. Strongest metal on Earth.,MALE
KLAUE,"It's not just a metal... They sew it into their clothes, it powers their city, their tech, their weapons...",MALE
ROSS,Weapons?,MALE
KLAUE,Oh yes. Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.,MALE
ROSS,That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium.,MALE
KLAUE,I stole all of it?,MALE
KLAUE,All of it? I took a tiny piece of it. They have a mountain full of it. They've been mining it for thousands of years and still haven't scratched the surface.,MALE
KLAUE,"I'm the only outsider who's seen it, and got out of there alive.  If you don't believe me you ask your friend what his suit is made of... what his claws are made of...",MALE
ROSS,Your father told the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had. But now he's telling me you have more?,MALE
T'CHALA,"And you believe the word of an arms dealer, strapped to a chair.",MALE
NAKIA,Where is that?,FEMALE
CIA AGENT,Back there.,FEMALE
ROSS,How much more are you hiding?,MALE
NAKIA,Something's happening out back.,FEMALE
KLAUE,I see you took your time didn't you!,MALE
OKOYE,My King!,FEMALE
OKOYE,My King... Nakia.,FEMALE
NAKIA,He just jumped in front of me.,FEMALE
NAKIA,"I don't think he'll make it here, it hit his spine.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,Give me a Kimoyo bead.,MALE
T'CHALA,This will stabilize him for now.,MALE
T'CHALA,Give him to us. We can save him.,MALE
OKOYE,Our missions was to bring back Klaue. We failed. This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders?,FEMALE
NAKIA,He took a bullet for me.,FEMALE
OKOYE,That was his choice.,FEMALE
NAKIA,So now we are just supposed to let him die?,FEMALE
OKOYE,"Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as King, it is your duty to protect ours.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,"I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.",MALE
OKOYE,Where exactly are we taking him?,FEMALE
SHURI,"Great, another broken white boy for us to fix. This is going to be fun.",FEMALE
SHURI,He will live.,FEMALE
SHURI,W'Kabi is here.,FEMALE
W'KABI,"What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?",MALE
T'CHALA,He's not here.,MALE
T'CHALA,He slipped through our hands.,MALE
W'KABI,Slipped? For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing. With you I thought it would be different. But it's more of the same.,MALE
LIMBANI,"Let's get going, boss.",MALE
KILLMONGER,You always sell to the CIA?,MALE
KLAUE,"I sell to the highest bidder. Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid.",MALE
KILLMONGER,"Oh I ain't worried about the money, bro. I know you're good for it.",MALE
KILLMONGER,"On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.",MALE
KLAUE,"You don't wanna go there, boy.",MALE
KILLMONGER,Yea I do.,MALE
KLAUE,"Drop it, or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. Put your gun down now!",MALE
LINDA,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Erik.",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,It's gonna be ok.,MALE
KLAUE,... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages.,MALE
KLAUE,This is what they do to people like us.,MALE
KILLMONGER,I ain't worried about no brand. Check these out.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Each one is for a kill.,MALE
KLAUE,"You can scar yourself as much as you like. To them, you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there.",MALE
KLAUE,And to think I saw you as some crazy American.,MALE
T'CHALA,Leave us.,MALE
ZURI,So your mission did not go as planned.,MALE
T'CHALA,What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one.,MALE
ZURI,That is not possible.,MALE
T'CHALA,He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring. My grandfather ' s ring. Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth.,MALE
ZURI,"Some truths are too much to bear, T'Challa.",MALE
T'CHALA,That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?,MALE
ZURI,I promised the King to say nothing.,MALE
T'CHALA,I am your King now!,MALE
ZURI,Your uncle took a War Dog assignment in America. Your father placed me there to observe unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child. The hardships he saw there radicalized your uncle.,MALE
N'JOBU,"I observed for as long as I could! Their leaders have been assassinated, communities flooded with drugs and weapons, they are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the planet our people suffer because they don't have the tools to fight back. With vibranium weapons they could overthrow every country and Wakanda could rule them all, the right way...",MALE
ZURI,"He knew your father would not support this, so your uncle betrayed us.",MALE
T'CHALA,No...,MALE
ZURI,He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.,MALE
T'CHALA,No no no no no no...,MALE
T'CHALA,"You will return home at once, where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes.",MALE
ZURI,He drew his weapon on me.,MALE
ZURI,Your father killed his own brother...,MALE
ZURI,To save my life.,MALE
T'CHALA,Speak nothing of this.,MALE
T'CHALA,And the child...,MALE
ZURI,We left him.,MALE
ZURI,We had to maintain the lie.,MALE
W'KABI,What is this?,MALE
KILLMONGER,Just a 'lil gift.,MALE
W'KABI,Who are you?,MALE
ROSS,"Alright, where am I?",MALE
SHURI,"Don't scare me like that, colonizer.",FEMALE
ROSS,Colon-who? My name is Everett.,MALE
SHURI,"Yes, I know. Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA.",FEMALE
ROSS,Right.,MALE
ROSS,"Ok, is this Wakanda?",MALE
SHURI,"No, it's Kansas.",FEMALE
ROSS,...How long ago was Korea?,MALE
SHURI,Yesterday.,FEMALE
ROSS,I don't think so. Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.,MALE
SHURI,"They do here. But not by magic, by technology.  Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.",FEMALE
ROSS,"These train things... that's magnetic levitation, right?",MALE
SHURI,Obviously.,FEMALE
ROSS,"Obviously... but I've never seen it this efficient. The light panels, what are they?",MALE
SHURI,Sonic stabilizers.,FEMALE
ROSS,Sonic what?,MALE
SHURI,"In it's raw form, vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed, so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.",FEMALE
ROSS,There's vibranium on those trains?,MALE
SHURI,There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Where is T'Challa? His Kimoyo beads have been switched off.,FEMALE
SHURI,"Well we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.",FEMALE
OKOYE,A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue.,FEMALE
SHURI,What?,FEMALE
OKOYE,W'Kabi is transporting him as we speak to the palace. We need to find your brother.,FEMALE
SHURI,An outsider?,FEMALE
OKOYE,"No, a Wakandan.",FEMALE
ROSS,He's not a Wakandan. He's one of ours.,MALE
T'CHALA,He killed his own brother... and left a child behind with nothing. What kind of King ... what kind of man does that?,MALE
NAKIA,No man is perfect. Not even your father.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"He didn't even give him a proper burial... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father may have created something even worse.",MALE
NAKIA,Hey. Look at me. You can't let your father's mistakes define who you are. You get to decide what kind of King you are going to be.,FEMALE
SHURI,"Brother, you need to get here now.",FEMALE
ROSS,Eric Stevens. Graduated Annapolis age 19. MIT for grad school. Joined the SEALs and went to Afghanistan where he racked up confirmed kills like it was a video game. They started calling him Killmonger. He joined a JSOC ghost unit.,MALE
ROSS,Now these guys are serious. They will drop off the grid so they can commit assassinations and take down governments.,MALE
T'CHALA,Did he reveal anything about his identity?,MALE
SHURI,He has a War Dog tattoo but we have no record of him.,FEMALE
RIVER TRIBE ELDER,Is this man Wakandan or not?,MALE
MINING TRIBE ELDER,Tell us what is going on.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Speak.,MALE
W'KABI,Speak.,MALE
KILLMONGER,I'm standing in your house. Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your King couldn't deliver.,MALE
T'CHALA,"I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are... now what do you want?",MALE
KILLMONGER,I want the throne.,MALE
MINING TRIBE ELDER,My goodness.,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,"Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good. There's about billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder, Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all.",MALE
T'CHALA,And what tools are those?,MALE
KILLMONGER,Vibranium. Your weapons.,MALE
T'CHALA,Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"Not your own? But didn't life start here, on this continent? So ain't all people your people?",MALE
T'CHALA,I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you.,MALE
RAMONDA,"Son, we have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request.",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,"Oh, I ain't requesting nothing! Ask who I am?",MALE
SHURI,You are Eric Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are.,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,"That's not my name, Princess. Ask me, King?",MALE
T'CHALA,No.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Ask me.,MALE
T'CHALA,Take him away.,MALE
RIVER TRIBE ELDER,Who are you?,MALE
KILLMONGER,"I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.",MALE
MINING TRIBE ELDER,The son of N'Jobu?,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest. You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer!,MALE
RAMONDA,You're lying!  Lies.,FEMALE
W'KABI,I'm afraid not Queen Mother.,MALE
MINING TRIBE ELDER,The descendant of N'Jobu.,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,Hey Auntie.,MALE
KILLMONGER,I'm exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of King and Black Panther. ,MALE
RAMONDA,Do not do this T'Challa.,FEMALE
BORDER TRIBE ELDER,As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights.,MALE
RAMONDA,He has no rights here.,FEMALE
RIVER TRIBE ELDER,The challenge would take weeks to prepare.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him... and somebody to get me out of these chains.,MALE
RAMONDA,"T'Challa, what do you know of this?",FEMALE
T'CHALA,I accept your challenge.,MALE
SHURI,He will never beat T' Challa. He should have just come to the first challenge and gotten it over with.,FEMALE
ZURI,The King will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away.,MALE
OKOYE,Where is Agent Ross?,FEMALE
NAKIA,I locked him in the office. He's not going anywhere.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"This is your last chance, throw down your weapons and we can handle this another way.",MALE
KILLMONGER,"I lived my entire life waiting for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed, just to get here.",MALE
KILLMONGER,"I killed in America, Afghanistan, Iraq. I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on the continent. And all this death, just so I can kill you.",MALE
ZURI,Let the challenge begin.,MALE
T'CHALA,Yield!,MALE
SHURI,Snap out of it T'Challa!,FEMALE
NAKIA,Get up.,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,This is for my father.,MALE
T'CHALA,"Zuri, no.",MALE
OKOYE,Zuri.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,Zuri don't!,FEMALE
ZURI,I am the cause of your father's death. Not him. Take me.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"I'll take you both, Uncle James...",MALE
T'CHALA,Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo!,MALE
KILLMONGER,Is this your King? Huh?,MALE
KILLMONGER,"Is this your King? The Black Panther, who's supposed to lead you into the future.",MALE
SHURI,Come on brother!,FEMALE
AYO,Is there nothing that can be done?,MALE
KILLMONGER,Him? He's supposed to protect you.,MALE
RAMONDA,No.,FEMALE
NAKIA,No!,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,Nah. I'm your King.,MALE
NAKIA,"We have to go now! Queen mother, let's go!",FEMALE
OKOYE,The Queen Mother and Shuri... they are safe?,FEMALE
NAKIA,Yes.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Thank you.,FEMALE
NAKIA,We should get to them immediately.,FEMALE
OKOYE,I cannot...,FEMALE
NAKIA,What...,FEMALE
OKOYE,Though my heart is with you.,FEMALE
NAKIA,We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago.,FEMALE
OKOYE,He is of royal blood.,FEMALE
NAKIA,He killed T' Challa.,FEMALE
OKOYE,In ritual combat.,FEMALE
NAKIA,Does that really matter?,FEMALE
NAKIA,You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has. Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong.,FEMALE
OKOYE,"Overthrow?! Nakia, I am not a spy who can come and go as they so choose. I am loyal to the throne, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to?",FEMALE
NAKIA,I loved him. I love my country too.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Then you serve your country.,FEMALE
NAKIA,No. I save my country.,FEMALE
ROSS,What's wrong?,MALE
NAKIA,"The King is dead. Come with me, unless you want to join him.",FEMALE
SHURI,"First Baba, and now my brother. Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.",FEMALE
NAKIA,It's me.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,Nakia. Who is this man?,FEMALE
NAKIA,He's a friend of T' Challa's he saved my life.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,Where is Okoye?,FEMALE
NAKIA,Okoye is not corning. She and Dora Milaje will serve the new King.  Wait here.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,What has happened to our Wakanda?,FEMALE
SHAMAN,Allow the Heart Shaped Herb to give you the powers of the Black Panther and take you to the Ancestral Plane.,FEMALE
N'JOBU,What did I tell you about going into my things?  What did you find?,MALE
KILLMONGER,Your home.,MALE
N'JOBU,I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.,MALE
N'JOBU,Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world. But I fear you still may not be welcome.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Why?,MALE
N'JOBU,They will say you are lost.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"But, I'm right here.",MALE
N'JOBU,No tears for me?,MALE
KILLMONGER,Everybody dies. It's just life around here.,MALE
N'JOBU,Well look at what I have done. I should have taken you back long ago.,MALE
N'JOBU,"Instead, we are both abandoned here.",MALE
KILLMONGER,Well maybe your home is the one that's lost. That's why they can't find us.,MALE
SHAMAN,"Breathe, my King. Breathe!",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,The Heart Shaped Herb did that?,MALE
KILLMONGER,This is all of it?,MALE
SHAMAN,"Yes. So when it comes time for another King, we will be ready.",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,Another King... yea go ahead and burn all that.,MALE
SHAMAN,"My King, we cannot do that. It is our tradition --",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,"When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit. Burn it all!",MALE
KILLMONGER,"You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place.",MALE
KILLMONGER,"I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them. We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side. It's time they know the truth about us. We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top.",MALE
KILLMONGER,The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire.,MALE
OKOYE,Wakanda has survived for so long by fighting when only absolutely necessary.,FEMALE
W'KABI,"Wakanda has survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General. Elders, it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up and soon it will be the conquerors, or the conquered. I'd rather be the former.",MALE
KILLMONGER,You heard your orders. Let's get to it.,MALE
ROSS,So where are we going again?,MALE
NAKIA,We're taking the Heart Shaped Herb to Jabariland.,FEMALE
ROSS,"Heart Shaped Herb, what is that?",MALE
SHURI,It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.,FEMALE
NAKIA,It's what made T'Challa so strong.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,"Nakia. I don't like this. The Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.  Nakia, you should take it yourself.",FEMALE
NAKIA,I'm a spy with no army. I wouldn't stand a chance.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,We'll go.,FEMALE
NAKIA,Stay calm.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,My son was murdered in ritual combat.,FEMALE
M'BAKU,Were the odds fair?,MALE
NAKIA,"Yes, but...",FEMALE
M'BAKU,"So, it was less a murder than a defeat?",MALE
SHURI,Do not rub our noses in it --,FEMALE
M'BAKU,"Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl.",MALE
ROSS,"Look uh, your highness, the new King is a --",MALE
M'BAKU,You cannot talk. One more word and I will feed you to my children.,MALE
M'BAKU,I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.,MALE
NAKIA,Great Gorilla M'Baku. This is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider sits on our throne. Only you can help us stop him.,FEMALE
M'BAKU,Come with me.,MALE
NAKIA,Impossible.  Is he breathing?,FEMALE
M'BAKU,"He is in a coma, barely clinging to life.",MALE
M'BAKU,One of our fishermen found him at the edge of the river border. He brought him to me. ,MALE
SHURI,Why do you have him in the snow?!,FEMALE
M'BAKU,It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors.,MALE
SHURI,We need to get him to my lab! I can heal him there.,FEMALE
M'BAKU,Take him. He' ll be dead in seconds.,MALE
RAMONDA,"Nakia, the Herb.",FEMALE
RAMONDA,I call upon the ancestors. I call upon Bast. I am here with my son T'Challa. Heal him. We must bury him.,FEMALE
RAMONDA,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
NAKIA,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
ROSS,Praise the ancestors.,MALE
SHURI,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
NAKIA,"Wake up, T'Challa. Wake up.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,My son.,MALE
T'CHALA,The time has come for you to come home and be reunited with me.,MALE
T'CHALA,Why?,MALE
T'CHALA,Why didn't you bring the boy home?,MALE
T'CHALA,"Why, Baba?",MALE
T'CHALA,He... he was the truth I chose to omit.,MALE
T'CHALA,You were wrong to abandon him.,MALE
T'CHALA,I chose my people. I chose Wakanda. Our future depended on --,MALE
T'CHALA,"You were wrong! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of the world. We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right. No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne. He is a monster of our own making. I must take the mantle back, I must. I must right these wrongs.",MALE
T'CHALA,Do you have a blanket?,MALE
NAKIA,Killmonger has the full support of our military. And he burned the garden of the Heart Shaped Herb.,FEMALE
ROSS,Of course he did.,MALE
ROSS,That's what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries.,MALE
ROSS,"They would always strike at transitions of power... like an election year or the death of a monarch. You get control of government, the military",MALE
T'CHALA,Our resources. The Great Mound.,MALE
SHURI,Our vibranium. All of my designs.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,He will send our weapons all over the world.,MALE
T'CHALA,You must get them out of Wakanda safely.,MALE
RAMONDA,What?,FEMALE
SHURI,What about you?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,The challenge will have to continue.,MALE
RAMONDA,"T' Challa, we will not leave Wakanda.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,It is my duty to keep you safe.,MALE
SHURI,"If he gets control of our technology, no where will be safe.",FEMALE
SHURI,The Black Panther lives. And when he fights for the fate of Wakanda I will be right there beside him.,FEMALE
NAKIA,As will I.,FEMALE
ROSS,I'm in too.,MALE
ROSS,What? You're gonna need all the help you can get.,MALE
M'BAKU,Are you done? Are you - are you done?,MALE
T'CHALA,Could you give me and Lord M' Baku a moment?,MALE
T'CHALA,Thank you.,MALE
M'BAKU,I owed you a great debt. A life for a life. Consider it paid.,MALE
T'CHALA,Please allow my mother to stay here.,MALE
M'BAKU,No harm will come to her I give you my word.,MALE
T'CHALA,You know I could use an army as well.,MALE
M'BAKU,I bet you could. But no. I will give no Jabari lives towards your cause.,MALE
T'CHALA,It is our cause. It is for all of us.,MALE
M'BAKU,Us? You are the first King to come here in centuries. And now you speak of us?,MALE
T'CHALA,"I cannot speak for past Kings. But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn. If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next?",MALE
M'BAKU,We will not help you.,MALE
W'KABI,Everything is on schedule.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Have the spies been alerted?,MALE
W'KABI,"Yes. Some have been resistant to our new mission. But the War Dogs in London, New York and Hong Kong are standing by.",MALE
KILLMONGER,We'll strike there first. The others will come around.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"Look at this. A handheld sonic cannon powerful enough to stop a tank. Untraceable by metal detectors, and we got thousands of 'em. The world's gonna find out exactly who we are.",MALE
OKOYE,He lives...,FEMALE
T'CHALA,N'Jadakalll!,MALE
KILLMONGER,Wassup?,MALE
T'CHALA,"I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead.",MALE
KILLMONGER,All that challenge shit is over with. I'm the King now.  Get those planes in the air! Carry out the mission!,MALE
T'CHALA,"Shuri, now!",MALE
SHURI,Copy that.,FEMALE
SHURI,"Go! Go go go go go! Come on, Ross!",FEMALE
KILLMONGER,"W'Kabi, kill this clown.",MALE
OKOYE,"W'Kabi, the challenge is not complete.",FEMALE
BORDER TRIBE ELDER,What will we do?,MALE
W'KABI,Border Tribe!,MALE
BORDER TRIBE ELDER,Ay! Ay!,MALE
W'KABI,Phambili!,MALE
OKOYE,You! Your heart is so full of hatred you are not fit to be a King.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Ayo. The King.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,W'Kabi stop this! Stop this now!,MALE
T'CHALA,NOO!!,MALE
SHURI,Nakia and I will get control of the Royal Talon with this.,FEMALE
ROSS,"Ok, so what do I do?",MALE
SHURI,You will have to fly it.,FEMALE
ROSS,What?,MALE
SHURI,"You were a great pilot. Don't worry, I'll guide you through it. It's just like riding a hoverbike.",FEMALE
ROSS,You guys have hoverbikes?,MALE
SHURI,"Nakia, take that.",FEMALE
NAKIA,I'm not a Dora.,FEMALE

SHURI,Brother!!,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Shuri!,MALE
SHURI,Brother!,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Turn on the train on the bottom track!,MALE
SHURI,But the stabilizers will deactivate your suit... you won't have protection!,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Neither will he.,MALE
SHURI,Okay!,FEMALE
KILLMONGER,I don't need a suit to kill you.,MALE
KILLMONGER,Your reign is over. You sat up here safe and protected.,MALE
T'CHALA,You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?,MALE
KILLMONGER,No I learn from my enemies -- beat them at their own game.,MALE
T'CHALA,"You have become them. You will destroy the world, Wakanda included.",MALE
KILLMONGER,The world took away everything away from me! Everything I ever loved! But I'm gonna make sure we're even.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"I'm gonna track down anyone who would even think about being loyal to you, and I'm gonna put they ass in the dirt, right next to Zuri.",MALE
SHURI,Nakia! Are you alright?,FEMALE
NAKIA,I'm ok. You?,FEMALE
SHURI,Yes.,FEMALE

KILLMONGER,"This is it for you, cousin.",MALE
KILLMONGER,Hell of a move.,MALE
KILLMONGER,My pops said Wakanda was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He promised he was going to show it to me some day. Can you believe that? Kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales.,MALE
KILLMONGER,It's beautiful.,MALE
T'CHALA,Maybe we can still heal you.,MALE
KILLMONGER,"Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah. Just bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships... 'cause they knew death was better than bondage.",MALE
T'CHALA,Thank you. You saved me. You saved my family. Our nation.,MALE

OAKLAND KID,Hey yo! Is this yours?,MALE
OAKLAND KID,Who... who are you?,MALE
T'CHALA,"My name is King T'Challa, son of King T'Chaka. I am the sovereign ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and for the first time in our history we will be sharing our knowledge and resources with the outside world. Wakanda will no longer watch from the shadows. We cannot, we must not. We will work to be an example of how we as brothers and sisters on this Earth should treat each other. Now more than ever, illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth: more connects us than separates us. In times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe.",MALE
FRENCH AMBASSADOR,"With all due respect, King T'Challa, what can a nation of farmers offer to the rest of the world?",MALE
SHURI,Are you playing around with that man again?,FEMALE
