ODIN,"Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.",MALE
ODIN,"Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.",MALE
ODIN,"The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.",MALE
KURSE,Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.,MALE
MALEKITH,Send the Kursed.,MALE
ODIN,"As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...",MALE
ODIN,"But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.",MALE
MALEKITH,Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.,MALE
ODIN,"Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.",MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?",MALE
BOR,If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.,MALE
FRIGGA,Loki.,MALE
LOKI,"Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?",MALE
FRIGGA,"Please, don't make this worse.",MALE
LOKI,Define worse.,MALE
ODIN,Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.,MALE
LOKI,I really don't see what all the fuss is about.,MALE
ODIN,"Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.",MALE
LOKI,I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.,MALE
ODIN,"We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.",MALE
LOKI,Give or take 5000 years.,MALE
ODIN,All this because Loki desires a throne.,MALE
LOKI,It is my birthright.,MALE
ODIN,Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.,MALE
LOKI,"If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.",MALE
ODIN,Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.,MALE
LOKI,And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?,MALE
ODIN,"Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.",MALE
SIF,I've got this completely under control!,FEMALE
THOR,Is that why everything is on fire?,MALE
SIF,You're welcome.  All yours.,FEMALE
THOR,Hello.  I accept your surrender.,MALE
THOR,Anyone else?,MALE
FANDRAL,Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.,MALE
GUARD,Keep moving. Come on! Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!,MALE
HOGUN,Where do we go next?,MALE
THOR,"Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.",MALE
HOGUN,You have my thanks.,MALE
THOR,"As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.",MALE
ODIN,Is Vanaheim secure?,MALE
THOR,As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.,MALE
ODIN,You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.,MALE
THOR,That was not my intent.,MALE
ODIN,"For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.",MALE
THOR,Thank you.,MALE
ODIN,Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.,MALE
THOR,"This isn't about JANE, Father.",MALE
ODIN,"Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you  I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.",MALE
SIF,There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.,FEMALE
THOR,I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.,MALE
SIF,"Well, the first was so much fun.",FEMALE
SIF,Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.,FEMALE
THOR,"No, this is one I set myself.",MALE
SIF,It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.,FEMALE
THOR,"I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.",MALE
RICHARD,Hi.,MALE
JANE,Hi.,FEMALE
RICHARD,So what's the story with you?,MALE
JANE,"Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.",FEMALE
RICHARD,"You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?",MALE
JANE,It's complicated.,FEMALE
RICHARD,Is he still around?,MALE
JANE,"No, he...went away.",FEMALE
RICHARD,"I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.",MALE
JANE,No!,FEMALE
RICHARD,"Oh, so many.",MALE
RICHARD,Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Sure, I'd love some.",FEMALE
JANE,"Richard, this is Darcy.  What are you doing here?",FEMALE

RICHARD,Ah.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes, you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.",FEMALE
JANE,"Is there a point to all this, cause there really has to be a point to all this.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Right. You know that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore? You might wanna start looking at it now,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,This is the reason we came all the way out here.,FEMALE
JANE,It's malfunctioning.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That's what I said.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That's what I did! But you just hit a little more scientific.,FEMALE
JANE,I'm sure it's nothing.,FEMALE
RICHARD,Yeah.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"It didn't look like nothing. Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.  Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.",FEMALE
JANE,He's not interested. I'm not interested. Time for you to go now.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Okay.,FEMALE
RICHARD,Short but sweet.,MALE
JANE,She needs help.,FEMALE
RICHARD,I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.,MALE
JANE,"Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.",FEMALE
JANE,"Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...",FEMALE
RICHARD,"Jane, maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go out to your friend.",MALE
JANE,This was so fun.,FEMALE
RICHARD,"You know, I'll just stay here and say sea bass alone.",MALE
JANE,And I hate you.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,What?! I thought he was cute.,FEMALE
JANE,Just shut up and drive.,FEMALE
JANE,Who's he?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,He's my intern.,FEMALE

IAN BOOTHBY,"Oh, uh...take a right.",MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Left!,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,I have totally mastered driving in London.,FEMALE
JANE,"Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you? I came here because you said you were onto something and then vanished.",FEMALE
STONEHENGE TV NEWS REPORTER,"I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Come on, this is exciting! Look, the intern is excited.",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Ian.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Do you want the phase meter?,FEMALE
JANE,No.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Bring the phase meter.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,The toaster looking thing.,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,I know what the phase meter is.,MALE
JANE,How do I change the ring tone on this thing?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,An Astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring tone.,FEMALE
JANE,Why are you calling me?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"I didn't want to shout.  Intern, the entrance is this way.",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Ian. My name's Ian.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"It's okay, we're Americans!",FEMALE
JANE,Is that supposed to make them like us?,FEMALE
MADDIE,Make it go away...,FEMALE
NAVID,Ssh!,MALE
JANE,"Oh, they're kids.",FEMALE
MADDIE,Are you the police?,FEMALE
JANE,"No, we're scientists. Well, I am.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Thanks.,FEMALE
NAVID,We just found it.,MALE
JANE,Can you show us?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That doesn't seem rigged.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Where did it go?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That's...that's incredible.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,What happened?,FEMALE
MADDIE,"Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.",FEMALE
JANE,I haven't seen readings like this since...,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,New Mexico?,FEMALE
JANE,Don't touch anything!,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Give me your shoe.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Where those the car keys?,FEMALE
JANE,Darcy!,FEMALE
MALEKITH,The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.,MALE
HEIMDALL,You're late.,MALE
THOR,Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.,MALE
HEIMDALL,Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.,MALE
THOR,Perhaps. How fare the stars?,MALE
HEIMDALL,Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.,MALE
HEIMDALL,You recall what I told you of the Convergence?,MALE
THOR,"Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?",MALE
HEIMDALL,"The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.",MALE
THOR,I see nothing.,MALE
HEIMDALL,Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.,MALE
THOR,How is she?,MALE
HEIMDALL,"She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...",MALE
THOR,What?,MALE
HEIMDALL,I can't see her.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Jane! Where the hell were you?,FEMALE
JANE,Tell me you didn't call the police!,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,What was I supposed to do?,FEMALE
JANE,Not call the police!,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,I was freaking out.,FEMALE
JANE,"You call the cops they tell the feds, the next thing you know we have SHIELD crawling all over area fifty-one-ing the place.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE
JANE,"We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Jane, you were gone for five hours!",FEMALE
JANE,What?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That's weird.  Typical.,FEMALE
THOR,Jane.,MALE
JANE,"Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.",FEMALE
THOR,"Well, I am. Jane...",MALE
JANE,Where were you?!,FEMALE
THOR,Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.,MALE
JANE,I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back,FEMALE
THOR,"I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.",MALE
JANE,"As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!",FEMALE
THOR,"Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool.  I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.",MALE
JANE,What?,FEMALE
THOR,I know...,MALE
JANE,You do?,FEMALE
THOR,Do what?,MALE
JANE,Hey! Is that you?,FEMALE
JANE,Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.,FEMALE
JANE,Hold that thought.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?",FEMALE
THOR,Space is fine.,MALE
JANE,Excuse me?,FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER #1,Are you Jane Foster?,MALE
JANE,Yes.,FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER #1,Do you know this man?,MALE
JANE,He's my intern. My intern's intern.,FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER #1,"This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me.",MALE
THOR,Jane! Jane?  You alright?,MALE
JANE,What just happened?,FEMALE
POLICE OFFICER #2,"Place your hands on your head, step back!",MALE
THOR,The woman is unwell.,MALE
POLICE OFFICER #2,She's dangerous.,MALE
THOR,So am I.,MALE
POLICE OFFICER #2,Requesting armed response officers to the scene.,MALE
THOR,Hold on to me.,MALE
JANE,What are you doing?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Holy shit!,FEMALE
JANE,We have to do that again.  Hi.,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,Welcome to Asgard.,MALE
MALEKITH,"Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light.",MALE
KURSE,Our survival will be your legacy.,MALE
MALEKITH,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world.,MALE
JANE,What's that?,FEMALE
EIR,Be still.,FEMALE
THOR,"This is not of Earth, what is it?",MALE
ASGARDIAN NURSE,"We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.",FEMALE
JANE,"That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?",FEMALE
EIR,It's a Soul Forge.,FEMALE
JANE,Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?,FEMALE
EIR,Yes.,FEMALE
JANE,It's a quantum field generator.,FEMALE
ODIN,My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?,MALE
THOR,She's ill.,MALE
ODIN,She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.,MALE
THOR,I brought here because we can help her.,MALE
ODIN,She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table.,MALE
JANE,Did he just...?  Who do you think you are?,FEMALE
ODIN,I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.,MALE
JANE,"Oh. Well, I'm...",FEMALE
ODIN,"I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.",MALE
JANE,You told your Dad about me?,FEMALE
THOR,"Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.",MALE
ODIN,"Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard.",MALE
THOR,"Don't touch her.  Jane, are you alright?",MALE
ODIN,That's impossible.,MALE
EIR,"The infection, it's defending her.",FEMALE
THOR,"No, it's defending itself.",MALE
ODIN,"Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.  But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.",MALE
THOR,"""Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."" They were these stories mother told us as children.",MALE
ODIN,"Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.",MALE
JANE,What happened?,FEMALE
ODIN,He killed them all.,MALE
THOR,Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.,MALE
ODIN,The Dark Elves are dead.,MALE
JANE,Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?,FEMALE
ODIN,"No, it does not.",MALE
MALEKITH,The Realms will be aligned soon.,MALE
MALEKITH,You'll be the last of the Kursed.,MALE
KURSE,Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.,MALE
MALEKITH,"You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you.  And then no power of our enemies will stop me.",MALE
KURSE,I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe.,MALE
LOKI,Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.,MALE
FRIGGA,"The books I sent, do they not interest you?",MALE
LOKI,"Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?",MALE
FRIGGA,"I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.",MALE
LOKI,Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.,MALE
FRIGGA,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,MALE
LOKI,"My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.",MALE
FRIGGA,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,MALE
LOKI,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,MALE
FRIGGA,Your father...,MALE
LOKI,He's not my father!,MALE
FRIGGA,Then am I not your mother?,MALE
LOKI,You're not.,MALE
FRIGGA,Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.,MALE
JANE,"When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.",FEMALE
THOR,"Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.",MALE
JANE,"Well, how's that possible?",FEMALE
THOR,"I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence.  During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost.",MALE
JANE,I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?,FEMALE
THOR,"I'll find a way to save you, Jane.",MALE
JANE,Your father said there was...,FEMALE
THOR,My father doesn't know everything.,MALE
FRIGGA,Don't let him hear you say that.,MALE
THOR,"JANE, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother.",MALE
JANE,Hi.,FEMALE
LOKI,You might want to take the stairs to the left.,MALE
FRIGGA,The prisons.,MALE
THOR,Loki.,MALE
FRIGGA,"Go, I will look after her.",MALE
FANDRAL,It's as if they resent being imprisoned.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,There's no pleasing some creatures.,MALE
THOR,"Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word.  Very well, you don't have my word.",MALE
ODIN,"Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.",MALE
FRIGGA,Odin.,MALE
ODIN,"Frigga.  Go!  It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.",MALE
FRIGGA,You've never been a very good liar.,MALE
ODIN,"Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.",MALE
FRIGGA,You take care.,MALE
ODIN,"Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.",MALE
FRIGGA,"It's only because I worry over you that you have survived.  Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.",MALE
JANE,"Yes, ma'am.",FEMALE
ODIN,Frigga.,MALE
FRIGGA,"Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.",MALE
MALEKITH,"I have survived worse, woman.",MALE
FRIGGA,Who are you?,MALE
MALEKITH,"I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine.  You have taken something, child. Give it back.  Witch! Where is the Aether?",MALE
FRIGGA,I'll never tell.,MALE
MALEKITH,I believe you.,MALE
SELVIG,"The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align.  Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and...  Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other.  But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic.  My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.  This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions?",FEMALE
PATIENT,Yeah. Can I have my shoe back?,MALE
KURSE,"I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.",MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,Jane Foster. You need to come with us.,MALE
FANDRAL,"We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless.",MALE
THOR,She's your prisoner now?  Leave us.,MALE
ODIN,I do not wish to fight with you.,MALE
THOR,"Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.",MALE
ODIN,"We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.",MALE
THOR,"Yes, and you will destroy us.",MALE
ODIN,You overestimate the power of these creatures.,MALE
THOR,"No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.",MALE
ODIN,"If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.",MALE
THOR,The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.,MALE
ODIN,"If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.",MALE
THOR,And how of our men shall fall on theirs?,MALE
ODIN,"As many as are needed!  We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.",MALE
THOR,And how are you different from Malekith?,MALE
ODIN,"The difference, my son, is that I will win.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,What's SHIELD?,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"It's a secret.  Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.",FEMALE
NEWS REPORTER,"Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, SELVIG, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.",MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again?",MALE
NEWS REPORTER,...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm...,MALE
THOR,You're not in Odin's war council?,MALE
HEIMDALL,The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go.  We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that?,MALE
THOR,"Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.",MALE
HEIMDALL,"I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.",MALE
THOR,"I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.",MALE
HEIMDALL,As are we all.,MALE
THOR,Well I see clearly enough.,MALE
HEIMDALL,The risks are too great.,MALE
THOR,"Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way.",MALE
HEIMDALL,What do you require of me?,MALE
THOR,"What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard.  We must move Jane off world.",MALE
SIF,The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,"There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.",MALE
THOR,"One, actually.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,No.,MALE
LOKI,"Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?",MALE
THOR,"Loki, enough. No more illusions.",MALE
LOKI,"Now you see me, brother.  Did she suffer?",MALE
THOR,I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.,MALE
LOKI,Go on.,MALE
THOR,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell.",MALE
LOKI,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,MALE
THOR,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you.",MALE
LOKI,Hmm. When do we start?,MALE
FANDRAL,He will betray you.,MALE
THOR,He will try.,MALE
LOKI,"This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?",MALE
THOR,If you keep speaking I just might.,MALE
LOKI,Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here.  Is this better?,MALE
LOKI,"Still, we could be less conspicuous.  Hm, brother. You look ravishing.",MALE
THOR,It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.,MALE
LOKI,"Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much.  Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer–  What?  You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something!  At last, a little common sense.",MALE
THOR,And I thought you liked tricks.,MALE
FANDRAL,"Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.",MALE
THOR,I won't be the one who comes for her.,MALE
JANE,I'm not hungry.,FEMALE
SIF,"Good, let's go.",FEMALE
JANE,You're...,FEMALE
LOKI,I'm Loki. You may have heard of...,MALE
JANE,That was for New York.,FEMALE
LOKI,I like her.,MALE
SIF,And what of the All-Father?,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.,MALE
ODIN,You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?,MALE
HEIMDALL,"Treason, my lord.",MALE
ODIN,Whose?,MALE
HEIMDALL,Mine.,MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"My King, the mortal has been taken.",MALE
ODIN,"Stop Thor, by any means necessary.",MALE
GUARDS,There they are! Take them. On my command.,MALE
SIF,I'll hold them off. Take her.,FEMALE
THOR,Thank you.,MALE
SIF,Betray him and I'll kill you.,FEMALE
LOKI,"It's good to see you too, Sif.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.",MALE
THOR,"That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,I will give you as much time as I can.,MALE
THOR,"Thank you, my friend.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,If you even think about betraying him...,MALE
LOKI,You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line.   I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.,MALE
THOR,"I said, ""how hard could it be?""",MALE
GUARD,They're on the ship!,MALE
LOKI,"They're on the ship!  Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.",MALE
THOR,"Shut up, Loki.",MALE
LOKI,You must have missed something.,MALE
THOR,"No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.",MALE
LOKI,"No, don't hit it, just press it gently.",MALE
THOR,I am pressing it gently. It's not working!,MALE
GUARDS,Get him! Get him!,MALE
LOKI,I think you missed a column.,MALE
THOR,Shut up!,MALE
LOKI,"Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.",MALE
THOR,"Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly?",MALE
LOKI,"Oh, dear. Is she dead?",MALE
THOR,Jane.,MALE
JANE,I'm okay.,FEMALE
THOR,Not a word.,MALE
LOKI,Now they're following us.  Now they're firing at us!,MALE
THOR,"Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting!",MALE
LOKI,"Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather.  You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!",MALE
FANDRAL,"I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki.",MALE
LOKI,You lied to me. I'm impressed.,MALE
THOR,"I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway.  Fandral.",MALE
FANDRAL,"Right.  For Asgard.  Nothing personal, boys!",MALE
THOR,Loki!,MALE
LOKI,If it were easy everyone would do it.,MALE
THOR,Are you mad?,MALE
LOKI,Possibly.  Ta-da!,MALE
KURSE,We must attack now.,MALE
MALEKITH,No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home.,MALE
LOKI,What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.,MALE
THOR,It would consume you.,MALE
LOKI,"She's holding up alright, for now.",MALE
THOR,She's strong in ways you'd never even know.,MALE
LOKI,Say goodbye.,MALE
THOR,Not this day.,MALE
LOKI,"This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.",MALE
THOR,And will that satisfy you?,MALE
LOKI,Satisfaction is not in my nature.,MALE
THOR,Surrender not in mine.,MALE
LOKI,The son of Odin.,MALE
THOR,"No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!",MALE
LOKI,Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!,MALE
THOR,What help were you in your cell?,MALE
LOKI,Who put me there? Who put me there?!,MALE
THOR,You know damn well! You know damn well who!  She wouldn't want us to fight.,MALE
LOKI,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.",MALE
THOR,I wish I could trust you.,MALE
LOKI,Trust my rage.,MALE
DESK OFFICER,"You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.",MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.",MALE
DESK OFFICER,"One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine.  Various.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Erik.,FEMALE
DESK OFFICER,And...  These.,MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Yeah, those. Thank goodness.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Erik.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Yes?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,It's uh...Darcy.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Darcy.  It's so good to see you.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Uh...I missed you too.,FEMALE
SELVIG,How did you find me?,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,You were naked on TV.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Okay, time to go. Lots to do.  Getting weird now.  I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period.",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either.  Are you alright?,MALE
SELVIG,I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it.,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.",MALE
SELVIG,"It's happening, sooner than I calculated.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Wait, what's happening?  Birds? Birds are happening?",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Erik?,FEMALE
SELVIG,Look.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Where did they go?  What the hell was that?!  Why are you smiling?,FEMALE
SELVIG,There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.  Take me to Jane's lab!,FEMALE
THOR,Jane.,MALE
JANE,Malekith.,FEMALE
THOR,"Alright, are you ready?",MALE
LOKI,I am.  You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.,MALE
THOR,"Yeah, possibly.",MALE
LOKI,"You still don't trust me, brother?",MALE
THOR,Would you?,MALE
LOKI,"No, I wouldn't.",MALE
JANE,Thor! No!,FEMALE
LOKI,"You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you?  All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet!  Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift!  I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.",MALE
KURSE,"He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell.",MALE
MALEKITH,Look at me.,MALE
THOR,"Loki, now!   No!",MALE
LOKI,"See you in hell, monster!",MALE
THOR,"No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!",MALE
LOKI,I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool!,MALE
THOR,"Stay with me, okay?",MALE
LOKI,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,MALE
THOR,Shh.,MALE
LOKI,I'm sorry.,MALE
THOR,It's okay.  It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.,MALE
LOKI,I didn't do it for him.,MALE
THOR,No!,MALE
JANE,"He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.",FEMALE
THOR,"How? Jane, how?",MALE
JANE,I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?,FEMALE
THOR,The Convergence.,MALE
JANE,"Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.",FEMALE
THOR,Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.,MALE
JANE,I only found it because I was looking for you.,FEMALE
THOR,Jane.,MALE
JANE,Now we're trapped here.,FEMALE
THOR,It's not me.,MALE
JANE,Hello?,FEMALE
RICHARD,"Hi, Jane, it's Richard.",MALE
JANE,Richard?! Where are you?,FEMALE
RICHARD,I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today.,MALE
JANE,"Oh, my God! This is amazing.",FEMALE
RICHARD,Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.,MALE
JANE,How am I getting service here?,FEMALE
RICHARD,Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?,MALE
JANE,"No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.",FEMALE
RICHARD,Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.,MALE
JANE,"Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?",FEMALE
RICHARD,"Yeah, I will.",MALE
JANE,"Oh, my God.",FEMALE
RICHARD,Am I interrupting something.,MALE
JANE,"No, no, no, nothing at all.  Come on.",FEMALE
RICHARD,"I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel?",MALE
THOR,Where are we going?,MALE
RICHARD,Hello?,MALE
THOR,Why are there so many shoes in here?,MALE
RICHARD,I'll just text her.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE
JANE,Hey.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy!  All the stuff we saw is spreading.  Did you go to a party?",FEMALE
JANE,Erik?!,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Jane, how wonderful!  You've been to Asgard.",FEMALE
JANE,Where are your pants?,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.",MALE
JANE,"Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.",FEMALE
SELVIG,Okay.,FEMALE
THOR,"Are you well, Erik?",MALE
SELVIG,"Your brother is not coming, is he?",FEMALE
THOR,Loki is dead.,MALE
SELVIG,"Oh, thank God.  I...I'm so sorry.",FEMALE
THOR,Thank you.,MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.",MALE
ODIN,Thor?,MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,"There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...",MALE
ODIN,What?,MALE
ASGARDIAN EINHERJAR,We found a body.,MALE
ODIN,Loki.,MALE
JANE,Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.",FEMALE
THOR,"Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.",MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Well, how do we know where that is?",FEMALE
SELVIG,"We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it.  All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map.  Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here.",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Greenwich?,MALE
JANE,"The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart.",FEMALE
SELVIG,I better get my pants.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,They're taped together!,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Do you even know what these things do?,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,No.,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Neither do I.  Come on, come on!",FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Fine!,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Holy shit!,FEMALE
MALEKITH,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.",MALE
THOR,Not by your hand!,MALE
MALEKITH,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished.,MALE
SELVIG,We're running out of time.,FEMALE
JANE,Almost there.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.",FEMALE
JANE,"Oh, come on.  Come on, Darcy.",FEMALE
THOR,"You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder.",MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Done.,MALE
SELVIG,The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.,FEMALE
JANE,"That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.  Okay, you might wanna hold on to something.",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,That is awesome! How did you do that?,FEMALE
JANE,"Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...",FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"Oh, there's a guy with a sword!",FEMALE
JANE,Oops.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Let's go.,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,What the hell just happened?  Move!,FEMALE
JANE,What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!,FEMALE
STUDENT,"You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything!",FEMALE
CONTROL,Confirming ship is hostile.,NEUTRAL
PILOT,"Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.",MALE
CONTROL,Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way.  Missile off target! I repeat...,NEUTRAL
PILOT,Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control!,MALE
SELVIG,What are you doing?,FEMALE
JANE,My signal's lost connection.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Jane! Come on!,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Are you alright?,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,You saved my life.,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Yeah. Yes, I did.",MALE
JANE,Darcy?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,Jane!,FEMALE
SELVIG,Ian?,FEMALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Selvig!,MALE
DARCY LEWIS,Meowmeow!,FEMALE
MAN,Mind the gap.,MALE
THOR,How do I get to Greenwich?,MALE
WOMAN ON TRAIN,"Take this train, three stops.",FEMALE
MAN,Mind the gap.,MALE
WOMAN ON TRAIN,Sorry. Sorry.,FEMALE
JANE,We're out of time.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Jane. Jane!,FEMALE
JANE,Thor! We're too late.,FEMALE
SELVIG,The Convergence is at its peak.,FEMALE
THOR,Can those things stop him?,MALE
SELVIG,Not from here.,FEMALE
JANE,We can't get close enough.,FEMALE
THOR,I can.   Malekith!,MALE
MALEKITH,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",MALE
THOR,I've come to accept your surrender.,MALE
MALEKITH,You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.,MALE
THOR,But you can.,MALE
JANE,Thor! No!,FEMALE
SELVIG,Jane!  Everybody okay?,FEMALE
DARCY LEWIS,"He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.",FEMALE
JANE,"Well, it's only been two days, so...",FEMALE
SELVIG,Did he say anything before he left?,FEMALE
JANE,"Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out.",FEMALE
SELVIG,Oh.,FEMALE
ODIN,You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?,MALE
THOR,"My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.",MALE
ODIN,"Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?",MALE
THOR,"When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice?  This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.",MALE
ODIN,"One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",MALE
THOR,"Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough?",MALE
ODIN,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",MALE
THOR,I shall try to be.,MALE
ODIN,"I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",MALE
THOR,I know.,MALE
ODIN,"If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.",MALE
THOR,"Thank you, father.",MALE
LOKI,No. Thank you.,MALE
COLLECTOR'S ASSISTANT,"I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.",MALE
THE COLLECTOR,"Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor.",MALE
SIF,You know why we're here.,FEMALE
THE COLLECTOR,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?",MALE
VOLSTAGG,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,MALE
THE COLLECTOR,That's very wise.  I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.,MALE
SIF,See that it is.,FEMALE
THE COLLECTOR,"One down, five to go.",MALE
SIF,I've got this completely under control!,FEMALE
THOR,Is that why everything's on fire?,MALE
SIF,All yours.,FEMALE
THOR,Hello.  I accept your surrender.,MALE
THOR,Anyone else?,MALE
LOKI,I really don't see what all the fuss is about…,MALE
ODIN,"Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!",MALE
LOKI,"I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.",MALE
ODIN,"We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.",MALE
LOKI,Give or take five thousand years.,MALE
ODIN,All this because Loki desires a throne...,MALE
LOKI,It is my birthright!,MALE
ODIN,"Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.",MALE
LOKI,"If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.",MALE
ODIN,"Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.",MALE
LOKI,And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?,MALE
ODIN,"Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.",MALE
DARCY,"Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.",MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,"Ian, my name's Ian.",MALE
DARCY,Do you want the phase meter?,MALE
JANE,No.,FEMALE
DARCY,Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.,MALE
IAN BOOTHBY,Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.,MALE
THOR,Jane?,MALE
JANE,Sorry. I just…needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.,FEMALE
THOR,I am. Jane—,MALE
JANE,Where were you?!,FEMALE
THOR,Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.,MALE
JANE,"I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.",FEMALE
THOR,"I know. I know, but the Bifröst was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging…I had to put an end to the slaughter.",MALE
JANE,"As excuses go, it's not…terrible…But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!",FEMALE
THOR,"Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.",MALE
MALEKITH,"Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.",MALE
KURSE,Our survival will be your legacy.,MALE
MALEKITH,The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.,MALE
ODIN,She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!,MALE
JANE,Did he just-? Who do you think you are?,FEMALE
ODIN,I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.,MALE
JANE,Oh. Well I'm-,FEMALE
ODIN,"I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.",MALE
JANE,You told your dad about me?,FEMALE
FRIGGA,You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.,MALE
LOKI,My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life…that I was born to be a king.,MALE
FRIGGA,A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?,MALE
LOKI,A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.,MALE
FRIGGA,Your father—,MALE
LOKI,He's not my father!,MALE
FRIGGA,Then am I not your mother?,MALE
LOKI,You're not.,MALE
FRIGGA,You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.,MALE
FRIGGA,"Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.",MALE
MALEKITH,"I have survived worse, woman.",MALE
FRIGGA,Who are you?,MALE
MALEKITH,"I am Malekith...  and I would have what is mine.  You have taken something, child. Give it back.  WITCH! Where is the Aether?!",MALE
FRIGGA,I'll never tell you.,MALE
MALEKITH,I believe you.,MALE
LOKI,Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?,MALE
THOR,"Loki, enough. No more illusions.",MALE
LOKI,"Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer?",MALE
THOR,"I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.",MALE
LOKI,Go on.,MALE
THOR,"I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.",MALE
LOKI,You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?,MALE
THOR,"I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.",MALE
LOKI,Hm. When do we start?,MALE
JANE,You're…,FEMALE
LOKI,I'm Loki. You may have heard—,MALE
JANE,That was for New York!,FEMALE
LOKI,I like her.,MALE
SIF,"Betray him, and I'll kill you.",FEMALE
LOKI,"Good to see you too, Sif.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,If you even think about betraying him…,MALE
LOKI,"You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.",MALE
LOKI,"You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant-",MALE
FANDRAL,"I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!",MALE
LOKI,You lied to me. I'm impressed.,MALE

THOR,What good were you in your cell?,MALE

THOR,You know damn well! You know damn well who!  She wouldn't want us to fight.,MALE
LOKI,"Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.",MALE
THOR,I wish I could trust you.,MALE
LOKI,Trust my rage.,MALE
THOR,I will tell Father what you did here today.,MALE
LOKI,I didn't do it for him.,MALE
DARCY,What the hell was that?  Why are you smiling?,MALE
SELVIG,There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.,FEMALE
MALEKITH,"You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.",MALE
THOR,Not by your hand!,MALE
MALEKITH,Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!,MALE
MALEKITH,"Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?",MALE
THOR,I've come to accept your surrender.,MALE
MALEKITH,You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!,MALE
THOR,But you can.,MALE
ODIN,"One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?",MALE
THOR,Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough?,MALE
ODIN,"It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.",MALE
THOR,I shall try to be.,MALE
ODIN,"I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.",MALE
THOR,I know.,MALE
ODIN,"If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.",MALE
THOR,"Thank you, Father.",MALE
LOKI,No... thank you.,MALE
CARINA,I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.,FEMALE
THE COLLECTOR,Asgardians! It's an honor.,MALE
SIF,You know why we're here.,FEMALE
THE COLLECTOR,"Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?",MALE
VOLSTAGG,The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.,MALE
