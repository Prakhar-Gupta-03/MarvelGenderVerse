PHIL COULSON,Campus should be clear in the next half hour.,MALE
NICK FURY,Do better.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Sir, evacuation may be futile. ",FEMALE

NICK FURY,Is there anything we know for certain?,MALE
SELVIG,The Tesseract is misbehaving.,MALE
NICK FURY,Is that supposed to be funny?,MALE
SELVIG,"No, it’s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she’s misbehaving. ",MALE
NICK FURY,How soon can you pull the plug?,MALE
SELVIG,"She’s an energy source. We turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level- ",MALE
NICK FURY,"We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space. ",MALE
SELVIG,"We don’t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. She’s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of Gamma radiation. ",MALE
NICK FURY,That can be harmful. Where’s agent Barton?,MALE
SELVIG,"The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.",MALE
NICK FURY,Agent Barton. Report.,MALE
NICK FURY,I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,I see better from a distance.,MALE
NICK FURY,Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?,MALE
NASA SCIENTIST,Doctor! It’s spiking again.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"No one’s come and gone. And Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM. If there’s any tampering, sir, it wasn’t this end.",MALE
NICK FURY,At this end?,MALE

LOKI,You have heart.,MALE
LOKI,Please don’t. I still need that.,MALE

GEORGI LUCHKOV,This isn’t how I wanted this evening to go.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I know how you wanted this evening. Believe me this is better.,FEMALE
GEORGI LUCHKOV,"Who are you working for? Lermentov, yes?",FEMALE
GEORGI LUCHKOV,Does he think we have to go through him to move our cargo?,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.,FEMALE
GEORGI LUCHKOV,"Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your outdated information betrays you. The famous Black Widow is just another pretty face. ",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You really think I’m pretty?,FEMALE
GEORGI LUCHKOV,Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to move the tanks. Tell him he is out. Well...You may have to write it.,FEMALE
WEASELLY THUG,It’s for her.,MALE
GEORGI LUCHKOV,You listen carefully-,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,"You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.  We need you to come in. ",MALE

YOUNG GIRL,My father-,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Like them?,MALE
YOUNG GIRL,Please!,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Should have got paid upfront Banner.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You know, for a man who’s supposed to be...",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"...avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Avoiding stress isn’t the secret.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Then what is it? Yoga?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,And you brought me to the end of the city. Smart.  I- uh- I assume the whole place is surrounded.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Just you and me.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"And your actress buddy? She a spy too, they start that wrong? ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I did.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Who are you?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Natasha Romanoff.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going to work out for everyone. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No, no. Of course not. I’m here on behalf of SHIELD. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,SHIELD. How’d they find me?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Why?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,What if I say no?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’ll persuade you. ,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,And what if the- Other Guy says no?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’ve been more than a year without an incident. I don’t think you want to break that streak.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, I don’t every time get what I want. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Doctor, we’re facing a potential global catastrophe. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Oh those I actively try to avoid.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,This  is the Tesseract.  It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,So Fury isn’t after the monster?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not that he’s told me.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,And he tells you everything?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Talk to Fury, he needs you on this. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,He needs me in a cage?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,No one’s going to put you in a-,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,STOP LYING TO ME!  I’m sorry. That was mean. I just wanted to see what you’d do.  Why don’t we do this the easy way where you don’t use that and the- Other Guy doesn’t make a mess? Okay?....Natasha.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Stand down. We’re good here.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Just you and me?,MALE
COUNCILMAN,"This is out of line, Director. You’re dealing with forces you can’t control. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"You ever been in a war, councilman? In a fire fight? Did you feel an over abundance of control? ",MALE
COUNCILMAN,You’re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Not Asgard, Loki. ",MALE
COUNCILWOMAN,"He can’t be working alone. What about the other one, his brother? ",FEMALE
NICK FURY,Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile. But he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. It’s up to us.,MALE
COUNCILMAN,"Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose. ",MALE
NICK FURY,Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy is. We need a response team.,MALE
COUNCILMAN,The Avengers Initiative was shut down.,MALE
NICK FURY,This isn’t about the Avengers.,MALE
COUNCILMAN,We’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks.,MALE
NICK FURY,"I’m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need. ",MALE
COUNCILWOMAN,You believe!,FEMALE
COUNCILMAN,"War isn’t won by sentiment, Director. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"No, It’s won by soldiers.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,There’s not enough time. I gotta put her in the water.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You won’t be alone.,FEMALE
SCIENTIST,Oh my God. This guy’s still alive.,MALE
NICK FURY,Trouble sleeping?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Slept for seventy years, Sir. I think I’ve had my fill.",MALE
NICK FURY,"Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up- they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"We’ve made some mistakes along the way, some very recently. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You here with a mission, Sir? ",MALE
NICK FURY,I am.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Trying to get me back in the world?,MALE
NICK FURY,Trying to save it.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,HYDRA’s secret weapon.,MALE
NICK FURY,Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who took it from you?,MALE
NICK FURY,He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,At this point I doubt anything would surprise me.,MALE
NICK FURY,Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You should have left it in the ocean.,MALE
TONY STARK,Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You disconnected the transmission lines? Are we off the grid?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Stark Tower’s about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I assume. Light her up.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,How does it look?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Like Christmas...,MALE
TONY STARK,...but with more- me.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,We’ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press.,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on the zoning for the next three buildings.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Pepper, you’re killing me at the moment. Remember, enjoy the moment. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Then get in here and I will.,FEMALE
JARVIS,"Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I’m not in. I’m actually out.,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Grow a spine, JARVIS. I got a date.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Levels are holding steady- I think.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which leads me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know now would I? ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What do you mean? All this came from you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, all this came from that.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself- twelve percent of the credit. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Twelve percent?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,An argument can be made for fifteen.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Twelve percent of my baby?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things and sorry but, the security snafu? That was on you. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Oh!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,My private elevator.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You mean our elevator.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I’m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later aren’t I? ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Not gonna be that subtle.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I’ll tell you what, next building is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,On the lease!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Call your mum, can you bunk over? ",MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Ah-,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Mr. Stark, we need to talk. ",MALE
TONY STARK,You have reached the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a message.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,This is urgent.,MALE
TONY STARK,Then leave it urgently.  Security breach. That’s on you!,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Phil! Come in!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Phil?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,I can’t stay.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, his first name is Agent. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Come on in, we’re celebrating. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Which is why he can’t stay.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"We need you to look this over, as soon as possible.",MALE
TONY STARK,I don’t like being handed things.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"That’s fine because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade. Thank you. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,This isn’t a consultation.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Is this about the Avengers?  Which I know nothing about.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t even qualify. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I didn’t know that either.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,That I did know.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,This isn’t about personality profiles anymore.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec? ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Half a moment.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"You know, I thought we were having a moment. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I was having twelve percent of a moment.  This seems serious. Phil looks pretty shaken.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,How would you notice- why is he Phil?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What is all this?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,This is- ah... ...this!,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Tomorrow.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You have homework. You have a lot of homework.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, what if I didn’t? ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"If you didn’t? You mean when you finished? Well, um, then-",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Square deal. Fly safe. They kiss.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Work hard.  So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia? ",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,I can drop you off.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear about the ah- cellist, is that still a thing?",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,She moved back to Portland.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What?...Boo.,FEMALE
FACELESS PILOT,"We’re about forty minutes out from home base, Sir.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me? ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought Gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine’s original formula.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Didn’t really go his way, did it? ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Not so much. When he’s not that thing though, guy’s like a Stephen Hawking. He’s like a- smart person. I gotta say- it’s an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present, while you were unconscious from-the-ice.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,You know it’s really- it’s just a- just a huge honor to have you on board- it’s...,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, I hope I’m the man for the job. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The uniform? Aren’t the stars and stripes a little...old-fashioned?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Everything that’s happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned.",MALE
THE OTHER,The Chitauri grow restless.,MALE
LOKI,Let them goad themselves. I will lead them in a glorious battle.,MALE
THE OTHER,Battle? Against the meager might of Earth.,MALE
LOKI,Glorious not lengthy- if your force is as formidable as you claim.,MALE
THE OTHER,"You question us? You question him? He who out the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? When you were cast out- defeated! ",MALE
LOKI,"I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed. ",MALE
THE OTHER,"Your ambition is little, full of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil. ",MALE
LOKI,"You don’t have the Tesseract yet.  I don’t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words. ",MALE
THE OTHER,"You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Agent Romanoff- Captain Rogers.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Ma’am.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Hi. They need you on the bridge; they’re starting the face trace.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,See you there.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. Thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet? ",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Trading cards?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,They’re vintage. He’s very proud.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Doctor Banner.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be coming. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Word is you can find the Cube.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Is that the only word on me?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Only word I care about.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Must be strange for you, all of this. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, this is actually kind of familiar. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Gentlemen, you might wanna step inside in a minute. It’s gonna get a little had to breathe. ",FEMALE
HELICARRIER INTERCOM,Flight Mode. Secure the deck.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is this a submarine?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Really, they want me in a submerged pressurized metal container?  Oh no, this is much worse.",MALE
CARRIER BRIDGE TECH 1,"Maximum performance take off, increase output to capacity. ",MALE
FEMALE CARRIER BRIDGE TECH,Power plant performing at capacity. We are clear.,FEMALE
MARIA HILL,"All engines operating. SHIELD emergency protocol one nine three point six in effect. We’re at level, sir. ",FEMALE
NICK FURY,Good! Let’s vanish.,MALE
MARIA HILL,Engage retro reflection panels.,FEMALE
MALE AGENT,Reflection panels engaged.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Gentlemen.  Doctor, thank you for coming.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Thanks for asking nicely. So, um, how long am I staying? ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Well where are you with that?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s still not gonna find them in time.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to?,MALE
NICK FURY,How many are there?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work? ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys. ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’m not sure-,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Oh you’re very young.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised? ",MALE
MARIA HILL,Was that not procedure?,FEMALE
MARIA HILL,Did you tell them who exactly is on your response team?,FEMALE
NICK FURY,Doesn’t appear that I have to.,MALE
SELVIG,Put it over there. Where did you find all these people?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need? ",MALE
SELVIG,"Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of. ",MALE
CLINT BARTON,Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.,MALE
SELVIG,"Well, I didn’t know. Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth. ",MALE
LOKI,"I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. What did it show you Agent Barton? ",MALE
CLINT BARTON,My next target.,MALE
SELVIG,"Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in. ",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube.",MALE
LOKI,I see why Fury chose you to guard it.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team. ",MALE
LOKI,Are they a threat?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way. ",MALE
LOKI,You admire Fury.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,He’s got a clear line of sight.,MALE
LOKI,Is that why you failed to kill him?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun. ",MALE
LOKI,"I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it. ",MALE
CLINT BARTON,That’s a risk,MALE
LOKI,Oh yes.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful.,MALE
LOKI,Tell me what you need.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,I need a distraction. And an eyeball.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"I mean, if it’s not too much trouble. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"No-no, it’s fine. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but- ",MALE
AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match. Wait- cross-match, seventy nine percent. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Location?,MALE
AGENT JASPER SITWELL,"Stuttgart, Germany. Twenty eight, Königstraße. He’s not exactly hiding. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Captain, you’re up.",MALE
LOKI,"Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL!  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel.",MALE
GERMAN OLD MAN,Not to men like you.,MALE
LOKI,There are no men like me.,MALE
GERMAN OLD MAN,There are always men like you.,MALE
LOKI,"Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing. ",MALE
LOKI,The soldier- the man out of time.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m not the one who’s out of time.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.",FEMALE
LOKI,Kneel!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Not today.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Guy’s all over the place.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Agent Romanoff, you miss me?",MALE
TONY STARK,Make a move reindeer games. Good move.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Mister Stark.,MALE
TONY STARK,Captain.,MALE
NICK FURY,He saying anything?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not a word.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Just get him here, we’re low on time. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don’t like it.,MALE
TONY STARK,What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
TONY STARK,"It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where’s this come from?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening?,MALE
LOKI,I’m not overly fond of what follows. ,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What are you doing?,MALE
TONY STARK,Now there’s that guy.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Another Asgardian?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,That guy’s a friendly.,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, we need a plan of attack. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I have a plan. Attack!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I’d sit this one out, Cap. ",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don’t see how I can.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods. ",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that.",MALE
THOR,Where is the Tesseract?,MALE
LOKI,"Oh-ho, I missed you too. ",MALE
THOR,Do I look to be in a gaming mood?,MALE
LOKI,"Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.",MALE
THOR,I thought you dead.,MALE
LOKI,Did you mourn?,MALE
THOR,We all did. Our father-,MALE
LOKI,"Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? ",MALE
THOR,"We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that? ",MALE
LOKI,"I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I who was and should be king! ",MALE
THOR,"So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki. ",MALE
LOKI,Well yes.,MALE
THOR,"Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.",MALE
LOKI,"I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it- ",MALE
THOR,Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?,MALE
LOKI,I am a king!,MALE
THOR,Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home.,MALE
LOKI,I don’t have it.  You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where.,MALE
THOR,You listen well brother-,MALE
LOKI,I’m listening?,MALE
THOR,Do not touch me again.,MALE
TONY STARK,Then don’t take my stuff.,MALE
THOR,You have no idea what you’re dealing with.,MALE
TONY STARK,Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes?,MALE
THOR,"This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours.",MALE
TONY STARK,-stay out of the way. Tourist.,MALE
TONY STARK,Okay! ,MALE
JARVIS,Power at four hundred percent capacity.,MALE
TONY STARK,How bout that?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Hey!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,That’s enough!  Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here-,MALE
THOR,I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then prove it. Put that hammer down.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer- ",MALE
THOR,You want me to put hammer down?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are we done here?,MALE
NICK FURY,"In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? Ant. Boot. ",MALE
LOKI,"It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me. ",MALE
NICK FURY,Built for something a lot stronger than you.,MALE
LOKI,"Oh I’ve heard. A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you? ",MALE
NICK FURY,"How desperate am I?... You threaten my world with war, you steal a force you can’t hope to control, you talk about peace and you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did. ",MALE
LOKI,"Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? A... warm light for all mankind to share? And then to be reminded what real power is.",MALE
NICK FURY,"Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,He really grows on you doesn’t he?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? ",MALE
THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"An army, from outer space? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. ",MALE
THOR,Selvig?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,He’s an astrophysicist.,MALE
THOR,He’s a friend.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. ",MALE
THOR,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,He killed eighty people in two days.,FEMALE
THOR,He’s adopted?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?",MALE
TONY STARK,"It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? ",MALE
MARIA HILL,He turns!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. ",MALE
MARIA HILL,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Finally. Someone who speaks English.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is that what just happened?,MALE
TONY STARK,"It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,...Thanks.,MALE
NICK FURY,Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.,MALE
NICK FURY,"I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. ",MALE
THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand-,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I do!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I...I understood that reference.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Shall we play, Doctor? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"This way, sir.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.,MALE
TONY STARK,If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,All I packed was a toothbrush.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Ow!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Hey!,MALE
TONY STARK,Nothing?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you nuts?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is everything a joke to you?,MALE
TONY STARK,Funny things are.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You think Fury’s hiding something?,MALE
TONY STARK,"He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Doctor?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"A warm light for all mankind,"" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I heard it.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The Stark Tower? That big ugly building in New York?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? ",MALE
TONY STARK,I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m sorry did you say-,MALE
TONY STARK,JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.,MALE
TONY STARK,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Following’s not really my style.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"And you’re all about style, aren’t you? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Out of the people in this room, which one is ""A"" wearing a spangly outfit and ""B"" not of use? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Just find the Cube.,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I’ll read all about it.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,But you can control it.,MALE
TONY STARK,Because I learned how.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,It’s different. ,MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?,MALE
TONY STARK,I guess we’ll find out.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,You may not enjoy that.,MALE
TONY STARK,And you just might.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,As soon as Loki took the doctor we...,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe. ",MALE
THOR,Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.,MALE
THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Like what?,MALE
THOR,"Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,No.,MALE
THOR,"Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.  When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. ",MALE
NICK FURY,War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?,MALE
THOR,"I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. ",MALE
THOR,What are you asking me to do?,MALE
NICK FURY,"I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? ",MALE
THOR,Loki is a prisoner.,MALE
NICK FURY,Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here?,MALE
LOKI,Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,But you figured I’d come.,FEMALE
LOKI,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton.,FEMALE
LOKI,I’d say I’ve expanded his mind.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?,FEMALE
LOKI,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff? ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Love is for children. I owe him a debt.,FEMALE
LOKI,Tell me.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. ",FEMALE
LOKI,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not let you out.,FEMALE
LOKI,"Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was. ",FEMALE
LOKI,And what are you now?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,FEMALE
LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic.",MALE
LOKI,...You lie and kill in the service of liars...,MALE
LOKI,"...and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code...",MALE
LOKI,"...something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away.",MALE
LOKI,"I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.  And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’re a monster!,FEMALE
LOKI,"Oh, no. You brought the monster.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So, Banner? That’s your play. ",FEMALE
LOKI,What?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you, for your cooperation!",FEMALE
NICK FURY,"What are you doing, Mr. Stark? ",MALE
TONY STARK,Uh- kind of been wondering the same thing about you.,MALE
NICK FURY,You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"We are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"And you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is Phase Two?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons. Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we’re- ",MALE
TONY STARK,"I’m sorry, Nick.  What were you lying? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Did you know about this?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor? ",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Loki’s manipulating you.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,And you’ve been doing what exactly?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Yes, and I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I’d like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.,MALE
NICK FURY,Because of him.,MALE
THOR,Me?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly- hilariously, out-gunned. ",MALE
THOR,My people want nothing but peace with your planet.,MALE
NICK FURY,"But you’re not the only people out there, are you? And, you’re not the only threat. The world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Like you controlled the cube!,MALE
THOR,"Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,A higher form?!,MALE
NICK FURY,You forced our hand! We had to come up with some-,MALE
TONY STARK,Nuclear deterrent! ’Cause that always calms everything right down.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark? ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I’m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep- ",MALE
TONY STARK,Wait-Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I’m sorry, isn’t everything? ",MALE
THOR,I thought humans were more evolved than this.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up? ",MALE
THOR,Tis your champion.,MALE
NICK FURY,YOU’RE NOT MY CHAMPION!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Are you boys really that naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You furious? I’m furious.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,And Captain America is on the threat poll?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We all are!,FEMALE
NICK FURY,That’s not your concern doctor!,MALE
TONY STARK,You’re on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I swear to God, Stark, one more crack... ",MALE
TONY STARK,You’re a threat. VERBAL THREAT! I FEEL THREATENED!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,SHOW SOME RESPECT.,MALE
TONY STARK,RESPECT WHAT!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"YEAH MAN HANDLE ME NOW, THAT’LL BE GOOD!",MALE
INTERCOM VOICE,Transport six-six-five-oh. Please relay your form code. Got you on the computer but not on the data log. What is your haul? Over.,MALE
JET PILOT,Arms to ammunition. Over.,MALE
THOR,"You speak of control, yet you court chaos! ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"It’s his MO, isn’t it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We’re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We’re- we’re a time bomb. ",MALE
NICK FURY,You need to step away.,MALE
TONY STARK,Why shouldn’t they guy let off a little steam?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You know damn well why! Back off!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I think I would just cut the wire.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Always a way out. You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"A hero, like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Put on the suit, let’s go a few rounds. ",MALE
THOR,"You people are so petty, and tiny. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, this is a team. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his- ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,WHERE? YOU RENTED MY ROOM!,MALE
NICK FURY,The cell was just-,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"IN CASE YOU NEEDED TO KILL ME. BUT YOU CAN’T, I KNOW, I TRIED!  I got low. I didn’t see an end so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Doctor Banner, put down the scepter.",MALE
NICK FURY,Got it!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Sorry, kids. You don’t get to see my party trick after all. ",MALE
THOR,Located the Tesseract?,MALE
TONY STARK,I can get there faster.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Look, all of us- ",MALE
NOVAR,"The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You’re not going alone!,MALE
TONY STARK,You gonna stop me?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Put on the suit, let’s find out! ",MALE
TONY STARK,I’m not afraid to hit an old man.,MALE

TONY STARK,...I’m gonna have to get in there and push.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, if that thing gets up to speed, you’ll get shredded! ",MALE
TONY STARK,Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that should-,MALE

SHIELD WORKER,A medical team is on its way to your location.,MALE
NICK FURY,They’re here.,MALE
NICK FURY,They called it.,MALE
NICK FURY,"These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them.  We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming.  Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative.   The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.  Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.",MALE
SECURITY GUARD,You fell out of the sky.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Did I hurt anyone?,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Lucky.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,You saw?,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here- didn’t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Thank you.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,Are you an alien?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,What?,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"From outer space, an alien? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,No.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"Well then, son, you’ve got a condition.",MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"So, which one is it? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Sorry?,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy that, ah- sometimes blows up large? ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,You know- I’m not even sure.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,You got somewhere to go?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Stark Tower. I- no. Yes.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm. ",MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"Well, that’s no different than anybody else. Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either. And since I’m not likely to move on from this placement, you may as well- pilfer my ride.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don’t know which way to go.,MALE
SECURITY GUARD,"Your mind’s already made up, son. The rest of you will follow.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clint, you’re gonna be alright. ",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,You know that? Is that what you know? I gotta go in though. I have to flush him out.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"You gotta level out, it’s gonna take time. ",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,You don’t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? You know what it’s like to be unmade?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You know that I do.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Why am I back? How did you get him out?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Thanks.  Natasha, how many agents? ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for. ",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Loki. He get away?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah. I don’t suppose you know where?,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We gotta stop him.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Yeah? Who’s we?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don’t know. Whoever is left.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Well, if I put an arrow through Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better I suppose. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Now you sound like you.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you? ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He didn’t, I just- ",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Natasha.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Was he married?,MALE
TONY STARK,"No. There was a uh- cellist, I think. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m sorry. He seemed like a good man.,MALE
TONY STARK,He was an idiot.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why? For believing?,MALE
TONY STARK,For taking on Loki alone.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He was doing his job.,MALE
TONY STARK,He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have-,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Right. How did that work for him?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?,MALE
TONY STARK,We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list-",MALE
TONY STARK,He made it personal.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,That’s not the point.,MALE
TONY STARK,That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,To tear us apart.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered....Son of-a-bitch.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Time to go.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Go where?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’ll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,I can.,MALE

NICK FURY,Agent Hill.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Those cards, they were in Coulson’s locker, not in his jacket. ",FEMALE
NICK FURY,They needed the push.,MALE
INTERCOM VOICE,We’ve got unauthorized departure from Bay Six.,MALE
NICK FURY,"They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything. ",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Yes, sir.",FEMALE
JARVIS,"Sir, I turned off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustaining ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Shut it down, Dr. Selvig. ",MALE
SELVIG,It’s too late! She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe.,MALE
TONY STARK,Okay.,MALE
JARVIS,The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I got that.  I’m beat. ",MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready for deployment. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock.",MALE
LOKI,Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh- actually, I’m planning to threaten you. ",MALE
LOKI,You should have left your armor on for that.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. You’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink? ",MALE
LOKI,Stalling me won’t change anything.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one. ",MALE
LOKI,"The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"The Avengers. It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing. ",MALE
LOKI,"Yes, I’m met them. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here. Your brother, the Demi-God; A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them. ",MALE
LOKI,That was the plan.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you. ",MALE
LOKI,I have an army.,MALE
TONY STARK,We have a Hulk.,MALE
LOKI,"Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it.",MALE
LOKI,"How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? This usually works. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, performance issues. You know? JARVIS, anytime now.",MALE
LOKI,You will all fall before me.,MALE

TONY STARK,"Just keep me posted.  JARVIS, find me a soft spot.",MALE
THOR,Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?,MALE
LOKI,It’s too late. It’s too late to stop it.,MALE
THOR,"No. We can, together.",MALE
LOKI,Sentiment!,MALE
CLINT BARTON,We’ve got civilians trapped.,MALE

POLICE SERGEANT,National Guard!,MALE
POLICE SERGEANT,Does the army know what’s happening here?,MALE
YOUNG COP,Do we?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You need men in these buildings. There are people inside and they can be running right into the line of fire. You take them to the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th. ",MALE
POLICE SERGEANT,Why the hell should I take orders from you?,MALE
POLICE SERGEANT,"I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. We gonna set up a perimeter all the way down to 39th street.",MALE
TONY STARK,It noticed me... ...yay!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What’s the story upstairs?,MALE
THOR,The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,How do we do this?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,As a team.,MALE
THOR,I have unfinished business with Loki.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Oh yeah! Get in line.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Save it. Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he’s gonna need us to-",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"So, this all seems horrible. ",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I’ve seen worse.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Sorry.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No, we could- use a little worse. ",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, we got him. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Banner?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Just like you said.,MALE
TONY STARK,Then tell him to suit up. I’m bringing the party to you.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don’t see how that’s a party.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Doctor Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry. ",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry.",MALE

LOKI,Send the rest.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Guys?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Call it, Captain. ",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we’re gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash. ",MALE
CLINT BARTON,Wanna give me a lift?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Right. Better clench up, Legolas.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thor! You gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow ’em down. You got the lightning, light the bastards up.",MALE

NICK FURY,"That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. ",MALE
NICK FURY,"Until I’m certain my team can’t hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population. ",MALE
COUNCILMAN,"If we don’t hold them in the air, we lose everything. ",MALE
