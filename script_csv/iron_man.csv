JIMMY,"I have a question, sir. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Please.,MALE
JIMMY,Is it true you’re twelve for twelve with last years Maxim cover girls?,MALE

PRATT,It’s a little embarrassing.,MALE
TONY STARK,Join the club.,MALE

NARRATOR,"Later, Stark’s work on the Manhattan project makes the end of the war possible.",MALE
NARRATOR,Stark Industries would go on to contribute to every major weapons system through the Cold War --,MALE
NARRATOR,But Howard Stark’s greatest achievement would come in 1973--,MALE
NARRATOR,"From early on, it was clear that Tony Stark had a unique gift--",MALE

OBADIAH,"Thank you...I, uhhh, I’m not Tony Stark, but if I were TONY STARK, I’d tell you how honored I am and...what a joy it is to receive this award. The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing -- he’s always working.",MALE
TONY STARK,"...you think we’re having a ‘moment’ here, but this is actually the logical conclusion of several mathematical truisms. Your hypothalamus is flooding your system with a chain of proteins called peptides, so that every cell in your body is opening itself up to the happy chemical: oxytocin. ",MALE
WOMAN,That’s...wow....,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Hold on a second --,MALE
TONY STARK,"-- so now your limbic system is positively...throbbing.  A Kirlian photograph of us right now, occupying this space, would show serious subatomic particles being exchanged between us, with a rapidity that transcends-- Are you getting this?  You will be quizzed --",MALE
TONY STARK,"My God, what are you, they roped you into this thing too? ",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Yeah.  They said you’d be deeply honored if I presented.,MALE

TONY STARK,It belongs to my old man.  They should have given it to him.,MALE

TONY STARK,Put it all on black.  Don’t worry -- it’s approved.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,...you just blew three million.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.  Don’t know what was more exciting -- winning it...or the fact that I don’t care I just lost it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Everything’s funny to you.,MALE
TONY STARK,No.  You’re not funny.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,We’ve got a hell of a day tomorrow. Can we get out of here now?,MALE

TONY STARK,Of course I respect your opinion.,MALE

TONY STARK,"Well Miss Brown, it’s an imperfect world and I assure you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I’ll start manufacturing bricks and beams to make baby hospitals. ",MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Rehearse that much, Mr. Stark? ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Every night in front of the mirror. Call me Tony.,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for a serious answer. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Here’s serious: my old man had a philosophy: peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Good line, coming from the guy selling the sticks. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,My father helped defeat Hitler.  He was on the Manhattan Project.  A lot of people -- including your professors at Brown -- might call that being a hero.,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,Others might call it war- profiteering.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Tell me: do you plan to report on the millions we’ve saved by advancing medical technology?  Or kept from starving with our inteli- crops?  All were breakthroughs spawned from, that’s right, military funding. ",MALE

PEPPER POTTS,The MIT commencement.  Yes or no?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Maybe.  Tell me your plans.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’ll tell them ‘yes’.  You want to buy the Jackson Pollock?  He’s got another buyer in the wings --,FEMALE

JAMES RHODES,Don’t start with me.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Jeez, we’re not getting hammered. Just a nightcap.  We’ll sleep better, arrive fresh.  It’s the responsible thing to do. I don’t know about you, but I want to sell some weapons.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You don’t get it.  I don’t work for the military because they paid for my education, or my father’s education.  Don’t cheapen it like that. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"All I said was, with your smarts, your engineering background, you could write your own ticket in the private sector -- on top of which, you wouldn’t have to wear that ‘straight-jacket’. ",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"‘Straight-jacket’?  This uniform means something.  A chance to make a difference.  You don’t respect that, because you don’t understand. ",MALE

JAMES RHODES,I will.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,That’s funny.,MALE
TONY STARK,You could tell?,MALE
TONY STARK,"The age old question: is it better to be feared or respected?  I say, is it too much to ask for both?",MALE
TONY STARK,"With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries Freedom Line.  It’s the first missile system to incorporate my proprietary Repulsor Technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.  I prefer the one you only have to fire once...",MALE
TONY STARK,"That’s how dad did it, it’s how America does it, and so far its worked out pretty well. Find an excuse to fire off one of these and I personally guarantee the enemy is not gonna want to leave their caves.",MALE
TONY STARK,"For your consideration, the Jericho...",MALE
TONY STARK,Now there’s one last creation I haven’t shown anyone yet.  You might be interested...,MALE

TONY STARK,...water...water.,MALE
HO YINSEN,I wouldn’t do that if I were you.,MALE
TONY STARK,What have you done to me?,MALE
HO YINSEN,"What did I do?  I removed what I could, but there’s a lot left headed for you atrial septum.  Do you want a souvenir?",MALE
HO YINSEN,"I’ve seen many wounds like this in my village.  The walking dead we called them, because it took a week for the barbs to reach vital organs.  I anchored a magnetic suspension system to the plate. It’s holding the shrapnel in place...at least for now.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"That’s right, smile.  We met once -- at a technical conference in Bern. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I don’t remember.,MALE
HO YINSEN,"You wouldn’t.  If I’d been that drunk, I wouldn’t have been able to stand, much less give a talk on integrated circuits. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Where are we --?,MALE
HO YINSEN,Stand up!  Do as I do.  Now!,MALE
HO YINSEN,"Listen to me, whatever they ask you, refuse.  You understand?  You must refuse.",MALE

HO YINSEN,You will build for him Jericho missile you were demonstrating.,MALE
TONY STARK,...I refuse.,MALE
HO YINSEN,"You refuse?  You will do everything he says.  This is the great Abu Bakar.  You’re alive only because of his generosity.  You are nothing.  NOTHING.  He offers you his hospitality, and you answer only with insolence  He will not be refused.  You will die in a pool of your own blood.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"Perfect.  You did very well, Stark.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"Good, I think they’re starting to trust me.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"Well, that’s the end of my plan.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"Quite a collection, isn’t it? ",MALE
TONY STARK,How did they get all this?,MALE
ABU,"As you see, we have everything you need to build the Jericho.  You will make a list of materials and start work right away.  When we are done we will set you free. ",MALE
HO YINSEN,"As you can see, they have everything you need to build the Jericho.  He says make a list of materials.  You will start work right away and when you are done he will set you free.",MALE
TONY STARK,No he won’t,MALE
HO YINSEN,...no he won’t.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Something’s not right.,MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,Looks like a standard hit and run.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Sir, I’m telling you, this was a snatch and grab.  A perfectly executed linear ambush.  As soon as they got what they wanted, they melted away. ",MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,"Intel’s on it, we’re in good hands. If he’s out there, we’ll get him.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,With your permission I’d like to stay in theater and head up the search and investigation.,MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,There’s a PR firestorm brewing over this.  Right now the best way to serve your country is to get back there and handle it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Tony Stark is the DOD’s number one intellectual asset, and I can be of value in the field. ",MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,"Duly noted, but we need you back home. Colonel, it’s not lost on me that Stark is a lifelong friend.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"I’m sure they’re looking for you, Stark, but they will never find you here.    That car battery is running out...and they won’t turn on the generator till you start to work.",MALE
HO YINSEN,"You don’t like what you saw out there, did you?  I didn’t like it either when those weapons destroyed my village.  What you just saw, that’s your legacy -- your life’s work in the hands of these murderers.   Is that how you want to go out?  Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to try to do something about it? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Why should I do anything, they’re either going to kill me or I’m going to die in a week. ",MALE
HO YINSEN,Then this is a very important week for you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, here’s what I need...",MALE
TONY STARK,"S-Category missiles.  Lot 7043.  The S-30 explosive tritonal.  And a dozen of the S-76.  Mortars: M-Category #1, 4, 8, 20, and 60.  M- 229’s, I need eleven of these.  Mines: the pre-90s AP 5s and AP 16s. ",MALE

TONY STARK,"...this area free of clutter, with good light.  I want it at 12 o’clock to the door to avoid logjams.  I need welding gear -- acetelyene or propane, helmets, a soldering set-up with goggles, and smelting cups.  Two full sets of precision tools. ",MALE
HO YINSEN,"...this area free of clutter, with good light.  He wants it at 12 o’clock to the door to avoid logjams.  He needs welding gear -- acetylene or propane, helmets, a soldering set-up with goggles, and smelting cups.  Two full sets of precision tools.",MALE

HO YINSEN,"Finally, he needs: three pairs of tube socks, white, a toothbrush, protein powder, spices, sugar, five pounds of tea, and some playing cards.  And a washing machine.  Top load.",MALE
ABU,A WASHING MACHINE?  DOES HE THINK I’M A FOOL?,MALE
TONY STARK,Must have everything.  Great Satan make big boom-kill for powerful Abu Bakar.  Big boom-kill. ,MALE
HO YINSEN,You do know they’ve removed all the explosives before they brought this to us.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I know, they’re crazy not stupid.",MALE
TONY STARK,This is what we’re looking for.  I need eleven of these.,MALE
HO YINSEN,Eleven?,MALE
TONY STARK,Heat the palladium to 1825 Kelvin.,MALE
HO YINSEN,How will I know when it reaches that temperature?,MALE
TONY STARK,The palladium will melt.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Careful, careful... ",MALE
HO YINSEN,Relax.  I always had steady hands. It’s why you’re still alive.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh yeah, thanks.  What do I call you? ",MALE
HO YINSEN,My name is Yinsen.,MALE
TONY STARK,Nice to meet you.,MALE
HO YINSEN,Nice to meet you too.,MALE
HO YINSEN,What are you building?,MALE
TONY STARK,A better mousetrap.,MALE
TONY STARK,What are you shaving for?  We’re almost done.,MALE
HO YINSEN,"Look like an animal, and soon you’ll start behaving like one.",MALE
HO YINSEN,That doesn’t look like a Jericho missile.,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s because it’s a miniature ARK reactor.  It should suspend the shrapnel in my chest and keep it from entering my heart.,MALE
HO YINSEN,What an original invention.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but this one is going to last a bit longer than a week. ",MALE
HO YINSEN,"It’s pretty small, what can it generate? ",MALE
TONY STARK,Three gigajoules -- per second.,MALE
HO YINSEN,That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes.,MALE
TONY STARK,Or something very big for fifteen minutes.,MALE
TONY STARK,Let’s put it in.,MALE
OBADIAH,"Sorry, did I startle you? ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,A little... ,FEMALE

HO YINSEN,"Stark, tell me what you’re doing, and I’ll tell you what I’m doing. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Looks to me like you’re making a crappy backgammon board.,MALE
HO YINSEN,Crappy?  This is Lebanese cedar.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Is that where you’re from, Lebanon? ",MALE
HO YINSEN,"I’m impressed you even know what this is.  How about we play, and if I win,  you tell me what you’re really making. ",MALE
TONY STARK,“A” I don’t know what your talking about.  “B” I was the backgammon champ at MIT four years running.,MALE
HO YINSEN,"Interesting, I was the champion at Cambridge. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Please don’t use ‘interesting’ and Cambridge in the same sentence. Is that still a school?,MALE
HO YINSEN,It’s a university. You probably haven’t heard about it since Americans can’t get in.,MALE
TONY STARK,Unless they’re teaching.,MALE
RAZA,Relax.,MALE
RAZA,The bow and arrow was once the pinnacle of weapons technology.  It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.,MALE
RAZA,Today...whoever has the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. Soon it will be my turn...,MALE
RAZA,What’s really going on here?,MALE
HO YINSEN,Nothing.  We’re working.,MALE

HO YINSEN,When he struck at the Prince with his finest sword -- it broke in half.  The Prince himself had become strong as iron...,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,So that’s it?  Everyone’s pulling the plug and moving on...,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,There’s nothing left we can do.  If there was any indication Tony was still alive--,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Spare me.  I read the official e- mail.  Thought maybe you’d have something different to say.,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"If anyone could figure out how to beat the odds, it’s Tony.  If it was you over there, he’d be finding a way to get you back.  Or inventing a new one. ",FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,What do you want me to do?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Be a better friend to him.,FEMALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,"What do you think you’re doing, Rhodes? ",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Going back there, Sir. ",MALE

JAMES RHODES,"Are you blocking my transfer, Sir? ",MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,Any one of these guys would kill for your career.  Are you telling me you’re willing to sacrifice that to fly a bunch of snake-eaters on a desert patrol half way around the world?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"I am, Sir. ",MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,Then I have one thing to say to you:  Godspeed.,MALE
GENERAL GABRIEL,As you were.,MALE
TONY STARK,We’re ready.  A week of assembly and we’re a go.,MALE
HO YINSEN,Then perhaps it’s time we settle another matter...,MALE

TONY STARK,Right back at ya.,MALE
TONY STARK,You never told me where you’re from.,MALE
HO YINSEN,I come from a small village not far from here.  It was a good place... before these men ravaged it.,MALE
TONY STARK,Do you have a family?,MALE
HO YINSEN,"When I get out of here, I am going to see them again.   Do you have family, Stark? ",MALE
TONY STARK,...no.,MALE
HO YINSEN,You’re a man who has everything and nothing.,MALE

REPORTER,Something besides weapons?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yes.  That’s right.,MALE
REPORTER,"The official report was sketchy. What happened to you over there, Mr. Stark?",MALE

JAMES RHODES,"Uhh, weren’t we taking him to the hospital?",MALE
REPORTER,"What do you intend to do about it, Mr. Stark? ",MALE
TONY STARK,"The system is broken -- there’s no accountability whatsoever.  Right now, as of this second, we are freezing the sale of all Stark weaponry worldwide.",MALE
TONY STARK,We’ve lost our way.  I need to re- evaluate things.  And my heart’s telling me I have more to offer the planet than things that blow up.,MALE
REPORTER,So you’re saying...what are you saying?,MALE
TONY STARK,"In the coming months, Mr. Stane here and I will set a new course for Stark Industries.  “Tomorrow Today” has always been our slogan. It’s time we try to live up to it.",MALE
OBADIAH,"Okay, I think we’re going to be selling a lot of newspapers here. What we should take away from this is that Tony’s back, he’s healthier than ever, and as soon as he heals up and takes some time off, we’re going to have a little internal discussion and get back to you. Thank you for coming by.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You mean that?  Or is this some clever stock-maneuver?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Wait and see.,MALE
OBADIAH,Well that went well.  You just painted targets on our heads.  Our stock is going to take a 40 point dive tomorrow.,MALE
OBADIAH,"TONY STARK, we are a weapons manufacturer.  Turning this company around to make baby bottles is like trying to get a bear to walk on its hind legs. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I don’t want a body count to be my only legacy. There are other things we can do.,MALE
OBADIAH,Like what?,MALE
TONY STARK,We could develop the Arc Reactor.,MALE
OBADIAH,This?  This was a publicity stunt. It’s not even cost effective.  We knew that before we built it. Repulsor technology is a dead end.,MALE
TONY STARK,No it isn’t.,MALE
OBADIAH,Oh my God.  It is a miracle you are alive. What must have happened to you over there? We’re a team.  There is nothing we can’t do if we stick together -- like your father and I.  Let me handle this.  But you have to lay low.  Don’t talk to the press again.  Can you do that for me?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yes.  Thanks Obie.,MALE
JARVIS,"Hello, Mr. Stark. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hello, Jarvis. ",MALE
JARVIS,What can I do for you?,MALE
TONY STARK,...I need to build a better heart.,MALE
JARVIS,"I’m not sure I follow, Sir. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Give me a scan and you’ll see.,MALE
JARVIS,What were your intentions for this device?,MALE
TONY STARK,It powers an electromagnet which keeps the shrapnel from entering my heart. Can you recommend any ugrades?,MALE
JARVIS,It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions.,MALE
TONY STARK,What are you talking about?  That is ridiculous.  That is exactly the purpose of this invention.,MALE
JARVIS,The energy yeild of this device outperforms your stated intention by eleven orders of magnitude. You could accomplish your stated goal with the power output of a car battery.,MALE
TONY STARK,Upgrade recommendations.  List.,MALE
JARVIS,Why are you talking to me like a computer?,MALE
TONY STARK,Because you are acting like one.,MALE
JARVIS,Shall I disable random pattern conversation?,MALE
TONY STARK,No.  It’s ok.  You are the only one who understands me.,MALE
JARVIS,I don’t understand you sir.,MALE
TONY STARK,Were you always this dry?  I remember you having more personality than this.,MALE
JARVIS,Should I activate sarcasm harmonics?,MALE
TONY STARK,Fine.  Could you please make your recommendations now?,MALE
JARVIS,It would thrill me to no end.,MALE
TONY STARK,Ahh that’s more like it.,MALE
JARVIS,Should I begin machining the parts?,MALE
TONY STARK,Machine away.,MALE
RAZA,Keep looking.  I want all of it.,MALE
CRAMER,Stark International: I’ve got one recommendation.  Ready?  SEELLLL! Abandon ship!  Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Hello.  This is Agent Coulson with Strategic Homeland Inter-,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yes.  I remember.  What can I do for you?,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,I’ve left a number of messages trying to get something on the books with Mr. Stark.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I know this is a priority for him. The next few weeks are a bit up in the air and I can’t set appointments without speaking with him first.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Do you know when you will be speaking with him again?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Not Sure.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Pepper?  How big are your hands?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,What was that?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Agent PHIL COULSON, I really have to go. Let me get back to you later.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,How big are your hands?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don’t under--,FEMALE
TONY STARK,-- just get down here.,MALE
TONY STARK,Show me your hands.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Just show me your hands.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Perfect, they’re small.  I need you to help me. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,So that’s the thing that’s keeping you alive.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,That’s the thing that was keeping me alive.  It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Amazing.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m going to swap them out and switch all functions to the new unit.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Is it safe?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Completely.  First I need you to reach in and--,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Reach in to where?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,The socket.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What socket?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"The chest socket. Listen carefully, because we have to do this in a matter of minutes. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Or else what?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I can go into cardiac arrest.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I thought you said it was safe.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I didn’t want you to panic.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Oh my god...,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Stay with me.  I need you to relieve the pressure on my myocardial nerve.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don’t know how to do that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m telling you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Sorry...,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Listen.  I’m going to lift off the old chest piece--,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Won’t that make you die?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Not immediately.  When I lift it off I need you to reach into the socket as far as your hand can fit and gently move the housing away from my heart.  Do you know which direction that is?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,To the right.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,To my right.  Your left.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,To the left.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Left.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Right.  Left.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,How deep does this go?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Keep going.,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s it.  Deeper.  Now press. Yes.  It’s releasing.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Ew!!! Pus!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"It’s not pus.  It’s an inorganic plasmic discharge.  It’s from the device, not my body. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Well it smells.  Am I done?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes. Thank you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Can I wash my hands now?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,The new unit is much more efficient.  This shouldn’t happen again.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Good, cause it’s not in my job description. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,It is now.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don’t suppose you want to go over things?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Can it at least wait until I install my new untested ground- breaking self-contained power source and lifesaving device prototype?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I suppose.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Throw that thing out.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Don’t you want to save it?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Why?  It’s antiquated.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You made it out of spare parts in a dungeon.  It saved your life. Doesn’t it at least have some nostalgic value?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Pepper.  I have been called many things.  Nostalgic is not one of them.,MALE
TONY STARK,There.  Good as new.  Thank you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You’re welcome.  Can I ask you a favor?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Shoot.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I don’t do well under that kind of pressure.  If you need someone to do something like that again, get somebody else. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I don’t have anyone else.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark? ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"That will be all, Ms. Potts.",MALE
JARVIS,"Still having trouble walking, Sir? ",MALE
TONY STARK,These aren’t for walking.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Ready to record the big moment, Jarvis? ",MALE
JARVIS,"All sensors ready, Sir. ",MALE
TONY STARK,We’ll start off easy.  Ten percent.,MALE
JARVIS,"That flight yielded excellent data, Sir. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Great.  I, uhh, think I know what this needs.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Manned or unmanned, which is the future of air combat?  For my money, no drone, no computer will ever trump a pilot’s instincts. His reflexes, his judgement--",MALE
VOICE,Why not take it a step further?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Why not...a pilot without the plane?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,That I’d like to see.  Look who fell out of the sky...,MALE
TONY STARK,Who wants to take these apart and put them back together?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,All right -- let’s wrap it up.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a while.,MALE
TONY STARK,Why not?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Figured you’d need a little time.,MALE
TONY STARK,Why does everybody think I need time?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You’ve been through a lot, thought you should get your head straight. ",MALE
TONY STARK,I’ve got it straight.  And I’m back to work.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Really?,MALE
TONY STARK,I’m onto something big.  I want you to be a part of it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Lot of people around here will be happy to hear that.  What you said at that press conference really threw everyone.,MALE
TONY STARK,I mean what I said.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,No you don’t.  You took a bad hit. It spun you around.,MALE
TONY STARK,Maybe I do need a little time.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,All right then.  Good seeing you.,MALE
TONY STARK,Likewise.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Thought you were done with weapons.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It’s a flight-stabilizer.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, watch where you’re pointing your “fight-stabilizer”, would you? Obadiah’s upstairs -- should I tell him you’re in? ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Be right up.,MALE
TONY STARK,This -- this is the big-big idea. It can pull the company in a whole new direction.,MALE
OBADIAH,That’s great.  Get me the design as soon as you can.  We’ve got a hungry production line that knock out a prototype in days.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know, I had a moment there where I was...reluctant...but I know now I made the best decision. I feel like I’m doing something... right, finally. Thank you for supporting me in this.",MALE
OBADIAH,"Listen, I have something to talk to you about.  I really wish you’d attended the last board meeting like I asked you to. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"I know, I’m sorry. What did I miss? ",MALE
OBADIAH,The board’s filed an injunction against you.,MALE
TONY STARK,What?,MALE
OBADIAH,They claim you’re unfit to run the company and want to lock you out.,MALE
TONY STARK,How the hell can they do that? It’s my name on the building! My ideas that drive that company.,MALE
OBADIAH,"They’re going to try. We’ll fight them, of course. ",MALE
TONY STARK,With the amount of stocks we own I thought we controlled the company.,MALE
OBADIAH,"I don’t know.  Somehow they pulled enough votes together.  Listen, the world doesn’t share your vision, Tony.  The more people have to lose, the more frightened they are of new ideas.",MALE
OBADIAH,"Now listen, I don’t want you to get all in knots.  You know how many times I protected your father from the wolves?",MALE
OBADIAH,"Get back to your lab and work some magic.  You let me handle the board. Oh and TONY STARK, no more press conferences.",MALE
TONY STARK,Nothing to it...,MALE
TONY STARK,All right.  Let’s get to work.,MALE
TONY STARK,Standby for calibration.,MALE
TONY STARK,Whoa--,MALE
TONY STARK,We should take this outside.,MALE
JARVIS,I must strongly caution against that.  There are terabytes of calculations still needed --,MALE
TONY STARK,We’ll do them in-flight.,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, the suit has not even passed a basic wind-tunnel test. ",MALE
TONY STARK,That’s why you’re coming with me.,MALE
JARVIS,I suggest you allow me to employ Directive Four.,MALE
TONY STARK,Never interrupt me while I’m with a beautiful woman?,MALE
JARVIS,That’s Directive Six.  Directive Four: use any and all means to protect your life should you be incapable of doing so.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Whatever floats you, Jarvis.",MALE
JARVIS,"Power: fifteen percent.  Recommend you descend and re-charge, Sir.",MALE
JARVIS,"Acknowledge, Mr. Stark--",MALE
JARVIS,Power at five percent.  Threshold breached -- ,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uhh, Jarvis?  JARVIS --?",MALE
TONY STARK,"STATUS, STATUS!  REBOOT --",MALE
JARVIS,Temporary power restored.  Descend immediately.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Jarvis, I think we need to chat about, uh, Directive Four. ",MALE
JARVIS,"May I remind you, the suit feeds off the same power source as your life-support.  A zero-drain of RT will likely kill you. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"You’re a downer, Jarvis.  But I appreciate the heads-up.",MALE
JARVIS,Shall I take over?,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, I got it, I got it --",MALE
TONY STARK,Perfect.  Let’s do some upgrades.,MALE
JARVIS,"That was quite dangerous, Sir. Might I remind you, if the suit loses power, so does your heart. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, and it doesn’t have a seatbelt either.  A few issues: main transducer felt sluggish at plus forty altitude.  Same goes for hull pressurization.  I’m thinking icing might be a factor. ",MALE
JARVIS,The suit isn’t rated for high altitude.  You’re expending eight percent power just heating and pressurizing.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Re-configure using the gold- titanium alloy from the Seraphim Tactical Satellite.  It should ensure fuselage integrity to 50 thousand feet, while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. ",MALE
JARVIS,"Shall I render, utilizing proposed specifications? ",MALE
TONY STARK,Wow me.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Hm.  Bit ostentatious, don’t you think?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Add a little red, would you?",MALE
REPORTER,"Tonight’s Red-Hot Red Carpet is here at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark’s third annual benefit for the Firefighter Family Fund has become the go-to charity gala on L.A.’s high-society calendar.  But this great cause is only part of the story--",MALE
REPORTER,"--the man whose name graces the gold-lettered invitations hasn’t been seen in public since his highly controversial press conference, and rumors abound. Some say Stark is suffering from post traumatic stress and hasn’t left his bed in weeks.",MALE
JARVIS,"The work could take till morning to complete, Sir. ",MALE
TONY STARK,Good.  I should come up for air anyway.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Eyyy, there he is.  My man!",MALE
TONY STARK,"Sorry, thought you were someone else.",MALE
OBADIAH,What are you doing here?  I thought you were going to lay low.,MALE
TONY STARK,It’s time to start showing my face again.,MALE

MAN,Mr. Stark.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Agent Coulson.,MALE
TONY STARK,Oh...was I supposed to meet you here?,MALE

TONY STARK,"Yes, you’re right.  I’m going to handle this right now.  Let me check with my assistant.",MALE
TONY STARK,Miss Potts -- can I have five minutes?  You look...you look like should always wear that dress.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Thanks.  It was a birthday present-- from you.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I have great taste.   Care to dance?,MALE
TONY STARK,I’m sorry.  Am I making you uncomfortable?  You seem very uncomfortable.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone I’ve ever worked with in a chiffon dress. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Would it help if I fired you?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You wouldn’t last a week without me.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m not so sure.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What’s your Social Security number?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Uh...,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,119-64-5484,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I’m sorry I was so uncomfortable. I hate being the center of attention like that and that’s why this one time in high school when I was supposed to be in a play... no, never mind... but you know that’s why I never like, wanted to have a big wedding... you know, because I thought everyone would be looking at me wearing a dress.  Oh, no, no... I’m not saying, like, “wedding.”  No, not like that.  I’m just saying, you know...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Can I get you another glass of wine?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"A vodka martini, extra dry, with extra olives as soon as possible. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Okay.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"And, Tony... ",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’m not a cheeseburger.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,No.  You’re not a cheeseburger.,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get a reaction from you.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,How’s panic?,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, they just put my name on the invitations --",MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,Is this what you call accountability?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,When were these taken?,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Yesterday.  Good P.R. move, you tell the world you’re a changed man, even I believed you. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I didn’t approve this shipment.,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,Well your company did.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Come with me.,MALE
TONY STARK,I made some promises I’m not going to be able to keep.  I suggest you pull all your money out of Stark Industries immediately --,MALE
OBADIAH,"Is this like a tick for you? Whenever you have a feeling, you start going to all the people who don’t trust you, who don’t protect you.  They’re going to put a spin on everything you say. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wait a minute.  I got to ask you something.   I’m dead serious about this.  I’m not kidding.  Am I losing my mind or is Pepper really cute?  Do you think she’s attractive and interesting, or is it just that her hair is down? I’ve been out of the game for a while. ",MALE
OBADIAH,"Are you out of your mind.  You’re messing with the “guys in the rooms”, we’re talking about billion dollar interests, the world order -- ",MALE
TONY STARK,I’m not worried about that right now --,MALE
OBADIAH,-- you should be.  You’ll disappear.  I can’t protect you against people like that --?,MALE
OBADIAH,DO YOU MIND?,MALE
OBADIAH,Tony don’t be so naive --,MALE
TONY STARK,"-- naive?  I was naive before, when I was growing up and they told me don’t ever cross this line, this is how we do business.  In the meantime we’re double-dealing under the table.  We don’t even deserve to represent the United States -- ",MALE
OBADIAH,"-- TONY STARK, you’re a child --! ",MALE
TONY STARK,"-- you don’t believe I can turn this company around, do you --? ",MALE
OBADIAH,-- you’ve got about as much control over things as a child riding in the backseat of your father’s car with a red plastic steering wheel in your hand.,MALE
TONY STARK,Maybe I’ll just get out of the car.,MALE
OBADIAH,You’re not even allowed in the car. I’m the one who’s filing the injunction against you.,MALE
OBADIAH,It’s the only way I could protect you.,MALE
TONY STARK,This is going to stop.,MALE
TV REPORTER'S VOICE,"-- the ten mile drive to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into Hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness.  Simple farmers and herders, from peaceful villages, driven from their homes at the butt of Western rifles and the turrets of modern tanks.  Displaced from their lands by Warlords and insurgent groups emboldened by their newfound power -- a power fueled by high-tech weapons easily purchased with Poppy money on the black market -- and further destabilizing a fragile region which for decades has been a tinderbox of tribal feuding and ethnic hatred --",MALE
TV REPORTER'S VOICE,"The villagers have taken shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find -- in the ruins of other razed villages, in the cold barren scrublands, or in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.

JAMES RHODES,"What the hell is going on here? Let me in there, Pepper.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You want to see him?  Fine.  See what you’ve done to him.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,Look at you...what were you thinking?,MALE
TONY STARK,Weapons I built are being used to kill innocent people.  Can’t let that happen anymore.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You can’t go around and blow up stuff every time you see something you don’t like on TV.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yes I can.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You got lucky, next time they’ll blow you to pieces. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"Next time, maybe I won’t play defense.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Does Pepper know about this?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You’ve put me in a tough spot here. What am I supposed to do?,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s up to you.  I’ve made my choice -- I’m not going to sit on the sidelines anymore -- I’m going to fight for what’s right.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Don’t you get it?  It’s not up to us to decide.,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s where you’re wrong...,MALE
OBADIAH,"Civilization, gentlemen, has been preserved by the right people having the right idea at the right time.  You are shaping in your hands, this very moment, the future of this company, and this nation. But it is imperative this project remain data-masked, that it’s existence never leave these walls. Make no mistake -- this is a ‘tool’, that in wrong hands, could jeopardize civilization as we know it.",MALE
HEAD ENGINEER,"Give us full access to the Sampson Cluster, and we’ll have you a prototype in record time. ",MALE
OBADIAH,The Sampson’s yours.  We go 24-7.,MALE
HO YINSEN,"Are you on the right path?  I don’t know...what does your heart tell you, Stark?",MALE
TONY STARK,This device will hack into Stark Industries mainframe. I need you to go to there and retrieve all shipping manifests.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What are you doing? Absolutely not you should be in bed...,FEMALE
TONY STARK,...they’ve been dealing weapons under the table and I’m going to stop them.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Absolutely not. I’m not helping you with anything if you’re going to start this again.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,There is nothing else.  There’s no art opening.  There’s no benefit. There’s nothing to sign.  There’s no decisions to be made.  There’s the next mission and nothing else. There’s nothing except this.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I quit.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Really?  You stood there by my side when all I did was reap the benefits of wholesale irresponsibility and destruction and now that I’m trying to right those wrongs and protect the people I put in harms way you’re going to walk out on me.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You’re going to kill yourself.  I can’t support that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"So far so good. Pepper.  I know what I have to do. I don’t know if I can, but I know in my heart that it’s right.  And you do too.  And I can’t do it without you.",MALE
HEAD ENGINEER,There’s no technology that can power this thing.,MALE
OBADIAH,"I told you, miniaturize the ARK reactor. ",MALE
HEAD ENGINEER,"I’m sorry, Mr. Stane, I’ve tried. What you’re asking for can’t be done. ",MALE
OBADIAH,Tony Stark was able to do it in a cave -- with a box of scraps.,MALE
HEAD ENGINEER,Well...I’m not Tony Stark.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Make a copy of everything--,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"What are you doing, Obadiah?",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,Translate--,FEMALE
OBADIAH,What a nice surprise.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I...just wanted to get some of my personal stuff.  And my resume.  In case. You know how I love job hunting.,FEMALE
OBADIAH,How’s Tony?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Honestly...I don’t know.  He’s shut me out.,FEMALE
OBADIAH,You and everyone else.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"This...thing between you, it’s hurting him.  You’re the only real father Tony ever had. It would mean so much if you could just talk -- ",FEMALE
OBADIAH,Tony’s imploding -- it’s unfortunate.    You should consider whether you want to take that ride with him.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,“Unfortunate?”,FEMALE
OBADIAH,"You know I love Tony -- but this is business.  We can’t save him, but we can save his legacy.",MALE
OBADIAH,"It’s tragic, but...Tony never really came home, did he?",MALE
OBADIAH,"This company has a bright future, I’d like you to be a part of it.",MALE
OBADIAH,Tony doesn’t understand your value. He never did.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Are you...offering me a job?,FEMALE
OBADIAH,"Think about it.  Come on, I’ll walk you out.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Miss Potts, did you forget our appointment? ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,No.  Of course not.  I’ve been very much looking forward to it.  Let’s-- -- why don’t we do this somewhere else?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"What gives, Jarvis? ",MALE
JARVIS,"You have a visitor, Sir.  Obadiah Stane is here.",MALE
OBADIAH,It’s UNOS.  Four cheese.  I just had it flown in from Chicago.,MALE
OBADIAH,I’d like you to proof-read something for me.,MALE
JARVIS,"Would you like me to spell-check it, Sir? ",MALE
OBADIAH,Can you turn him off?  All the way?,MALE
TONY STARK,Spin down Jarvis.,MALE
TONY STARK,Your resignation.,MALE
OBADIAH,You were right.  It’s not my company -- not my name on the building. We were a great team...but I guess this is where our paths diverge.,MALE
TONY STARK,Pepper.  I should take that.,MALE
OBADIAH,Tony.  Please.  I’ll be out of here in a minute.,MALE
OBADIAH,We have too much history to part on bad terms.  I’d like your blessing.,MALE
OBADIAH,"Easy, now.  Try to breathe...",MALE
OBADIAH,"You can’t mess with progress, Tony. It’s an insult to the Gods.  You created your greatest weapon ever -- but you think that means it belongs to you.  It belongs to the world.",MALE
OBADIAH,Your “heart” will be the seed of the next generation of weapons. They’ll help us steer the world back in the right direction -- put the balance of power back in our hands.  The right hands.,MALE
OBADIAH,"By the time you die, my prototype will be operational.  It’s not as conservative as yours.",MALE
OBADIAH,The sad thing is...we’re both the good guys.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?  Slow down.  Why would Obadiah-- Where is Tony now?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"--I don’t know, he’s not answering his phone.  Will you just go over there and check on him?  Thanks Rhodey.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I know a short cut.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,I’ll ride with her.,MALE
AGENT,Clear.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,TONY--,MALE
TONY STARK,Where’s Pepper?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Don’t worry, she’s with the Feds. They’re on their way to Stark to arrest Obadiah. ",MALE
TONY STARK,They’re going to need a lot more than a few Agents.  Give me hand.,MALE
AGENT,"Agents down, agents down! GET OUT OF HERE --",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Tony!  Obadiah’s got a whole assembly line under the Ark.  He’s inside one of them--!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Where are you--?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Obadiah...,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,Tony--,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, I have one thing I need to say to you:  DUCK!",MALE
OBADIAH,"It’s miraculous, TONY STARK, it’s your Ninth Symphony.  Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever. ",MALE
TONY STARK,This wasn’t meant for the world.,MALE
OBADIAH,How can you be so selfish?  Do you understand what you’ve created? This will put the balance of power back in our hands for decades. Your country needs this.,MALE
TONY STARK,What kind of world will it be when everybody’s got one?,MALE
OBADIAH,Your father helped give us the bomb.  What kind of world would it be if he’d failed us?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,TONY -- ARE YOU THERE?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"A little busy, Pepper-- ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,The reactor’s been it--,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Get to the control room.  Shut it down--,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,How the hell do I shut it down??,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Don’t.  This is our fight.,MALE
OBADIAH,"People are always going to die, Tony -- part of the chess game.",MALE
TONY STARK,Emergency power!,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, you’ll drain the -- ",MALE
TONY STARK,NOW!,MALE
KID IN THE BACKSEAT,"GO, MOM!  GO -- ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,TONY?  Where are you--?,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’m in the control room.  Now what?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Central panel.  Red button.  Press it.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Thanks, Tony. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What’s the delta rate?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,1-2-5-0.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Damn --,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Damn?!  I don’t want to hear “damn.”  GET UP HERE--,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, I’m delegating this to you. FIND A WAY!",MALE
TONY STARK,You know what happens when that reactor blows.  A lot of people are going to die.,MALE
OBADIAH,"It didn’t have to end like this, Tony.  You were down -- you should’ve stayed down.",MALE
TONY STARK,You had to take my car.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Saving your ass is getting to be a full-time job.,MALE
TONY STARK,Get this area evacuated!  There’s going to be a meltdown--,MALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, how we doing?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Thanks for checking in Tony. Delta’s at 2300.  It’s not going down.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It’s too late.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Too late?  What’s going to happen?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It’s going to blow a crater a mile wide.  I’m coming to get you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, wait.  Stay put -- we’re going to overload the reactor.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,IT’S ALREADY OVERLOADING --,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, it’s compressing energy.  We’re going to convert the plasma core to electricity and channel it up through the roof.  Like a Tesla coil.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I don’t need a science lesson, just tell me what button to push -- ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,See a red submarine hatch?  A wheel -- a red wheel.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,...no.  YES --,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Open it all the way, then standby to hit the master.  We’ve only got one shot at this. ",MALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, hit the switch.  PEPPER --",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,TONY?  Which Master Switch --,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I am so looking for another job.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Take my hand...,MALE
OBADIAH,"So this is the answer, Tony?  This is how you’re going to save the world?  It’s not in you.  Your father told me before he died, my boy doesn’t have a warrior’s heart. I should have listened. ",MALE
TONY STARK,My father never knew me.,MALE
OBADIAH,But I do.,MALE
OBADIAH,"Goodbye, my boy... ",MALE
TONY STARK,This is just the beginning.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Here, your alibi.  You were on your yacht.  I’ve got port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from fifty of your guests. ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Maybe it was just the two of us. On the yacht, I mean. ",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Focus, please.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"“Iron Man”.  Not technically accurate, since it’s mostly carbon- fiber and ceramic.  But I like the ring of it.  “Iron Man”...",MALE
TONY STARK,You know...that night at the concert hall.  Do you ever think about it?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I don’t know what you’re talking about, Mr. Stark.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Will that be all, Mr. Stark? ",FEMALE
TONY STARK,That will be all Miss Potts.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"--I can confirm that a series of military test-prototypes were involved in the incident at Stark Industries last night.  I can also confirm that there was, for a brief time, the danger of an Ark Reactor “incident”, which was rectified without injury to the public -- and all power outages have been restored.  Here now, to answer a few brief questions, is Tony Stark.",MALE
TONY STARK,I’ve seen the papers.  I’ve heard the reports.  That’s why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation.  The truth is--,MALE
TONY STARK,I am Iron Man.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Good.  And I want a Gatling gun on the right shoulder.,MALE
TONY STARK,--and a rocket launcher on the left?  Where are you going to store all that ammo?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Who’s suit is this anyway? And do it in silver and black, would you? ",MALE
