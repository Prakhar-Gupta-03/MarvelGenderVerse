350,SHURI,No no no no no no no!!,FEMALE
351,SHURI,Brother!,FEMALE
352,T'CHALA,Klaue!!,MALE
353,T'CHALA,Did you think we would forget!?,MALE
354,T'CHALA,Look at me murderer! Where did you get this weapon?,MALE
355,KLAUE,You savages didn't deserve it.,MALE
356,KLAUE,"Oh, mercy! King, mercy!",MALE
357,T'CHALA,Every breath you take is mercy from me.,MALE
358,OKOYE,King!,FEMALE
359,NAKIA,The world watches.,FEMALE
360,ROSS,"Come on guys, let's go huh?",MALE
361,KLAUE,"Hello! I can see you! I can, I can see you.",MALE
362,ROSS,"So, this is a big mess, huh? I figured we can go good cop bad cop. I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in --",MALE
363,OKOYE,We can't let him talk to Klaue alone.,FEMALE
364,T'CHALA,Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here.,MALE
365,T'CHALA,"After your questioning, we will to take him back to Wakanda with us.",MALE
366,ROSS,"What? No. Look I like you, a lot. But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere. Listen, I 'm doing you a favor by letting you even be in here.",MALE
367,OKOYE,"If he touches you again, I am going to impale him to this desk.",FEMALE
368,ROSS,Does she speak English?,MALE
369,OKOYE,When she wants to.,FEMALE
370,ROSS,"I'm going in. And when I'm done, you guys are up.",MALE
371,T'CHALA,--Agent Ross.,MALE
372,ROSS,Yea.,MALE
373,T'CHALA,I do appreciate your help in Busan.,MALE
374,ROSS,You see that? It's called diplomacy. You're welcome.,MALE
375,T'CHALA,Okoye! Play nice.,MALE
376,OKOYE,"Eh, Americans...",FEMALE
377,KLAUE,"You know, you really shouldn't trust the Wakandans. I'm much more your speed.",MALE
378,ROSS,"I don't trust anybody, not in this job. But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there. Where'd you get that?",MALE
379,KLAUE,It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like.,MALE
380,ROSS,Why don't you give me the name of your supplier and I'll ask them.,MALE
381,KLAUE,"He's right outside, why don't you ask him yourself?",MALE
382,ROSS,T'Challa? You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?,MALE
383,KLAUE,Bingo.,MALE
384,KLAUE,What do you actually know about Wakanda?,MALE
385,ROSS,Shepherds. Textiles. Cool outfits.,MALE
386,KLAUE,"It's all a front. Explorers searched for it for centuries. El Dorado: The Golden City. They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it. The gift. Vibranium...",MALE
387,ROSS,Vibranium yea. Strongest metal on Earth.,MALE
388,KLAUE,"It's not just a metal... They sew it into their clothes, it powers their city, their tech, their weapons...",MALE
389,ROSS,Weapons?,MALE
390,KLAUE,Oh yes. Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower.,MALE
391,ROSS,That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium.,MALE
392,KLAUE,I stole all of it?,MALE
393,KLAUE,All of it? I took a tiny piece of it. They have a mountain full of it. They've been mining it for thousands of years and still haven't scratched the surface.,MALE
394,KLAUE,"I'm the only outsider who's seen it, and got out of there alive.  If you don't believe me you ask your friend what his suit is made of... what his claws are made of...",MALE
395,ROSS,Your father told the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had. But now he's telling me you have more?,MALE
396,T'CHALA,"And you believe the word of an arms dealer, strapped to a chair.",MALE
397,NAKIA,Where is that?,FEMALE
398,CIA AGENT,Back there.,FEMALE
399,ROSS,How much more are you hiding?,MALE
400,NAKIA,Something's happening out back.,FEMALE
401,KLAUE,I see you took your time didn't you!,MALE
402,OKOYE,My King!,FEMALE
403,OKOYE,My King... Nakia.,FEMALE
404,NAKIA,He just jumped in front of me.,FEMALE
405,NAKIA,"I don't think he'll make it here, it hit his spine.",FEMALE
406,T'CHALA,Give me a Kimoyo bead.,MALE
407,T'CHALA,This will stabilize him for now.,MALE
408,T'CHALA,Give him to us. We can save him.,MALE
409,OKOYE,Our missions was to bring back Klaue. We failed. This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders?,FEMALE
410,NAKIA,He took a bullet for me.,FEMALE
411,OKOYE,That was his choice.,FEMALE
412,NAKIA,So now we are just supposed to let him die?,FEMALE
413,OKOYE,"Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as King, it is your duty to protect ours.",FEMALE
414,T'CHALA,"I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.",MALE
415,OKOYE,Where exactly are we taking him?,FEMALE
416,SHURI,"Great, another broken white boy for us to fix. This is going to be fun.",FEMALE
417,SHURI,He will live.,FEMALE
418,SHURI,W'Kabi is here.,FEMALE
419,W'KABI,"What's going on, brother? Where is Klaue?",MALE
420,T'CHALA,He's not here.,MALE
421,T'CHALA,He slipped through our hands.,MALE
422,W'KABI,Slipped? For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing. With you I thought it would be different. But it's more of the same.,MALE
423,LIMBANI,"Let's get going, boss.",MALE
424,KILLMONGER,You always sell to the CIA?,MALE
425,KLAUE,"I sell to the highest bidder. Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid.",MALE
426,KILLMONGER,"Oh I ain't worried about the money, bro. I know you're good for it.",MALE
427,KILLMONGER,"On our way back, just drop us off in Wakanda.",MALE
428,KLAUE,"You don't wanna go there, boy.",MALE
429,KILLMONGER,Yea I do.,MALE
430,KLAUE,"Drop it, or your little Bonnie and Clyde routine ends today. Put your gun down now!",MALE
431,LINDA,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Erik.",FEMALE
432,KILLMONGER,It's gonna be ok.,MALE
433,KLAUE,... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages.,MALE
434,KLAUE,This is what they do to people like us.,MALE
435,KILLMONGER,I ain't worried about no brand. Check these out.,MALE
436,KILLMONGER,Each one is for a kill.,MALE
437,KLAUE,"You can scar yourself as much as you like. To them, you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there.",MALE
438,KLAUE,And to think I saw you as some crazy American.,MALE
439,T'CHALA,Leave us.,MALE
440,ZURI,So your mission did not go as planned.,MALE
441,T'CHALA,What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one.,MALE
442,ZURI,That is not possible.,MALE
443,T'CHALA,He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring. My grandfather ' s ring. Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth.,MALE
444,ZURI,"Some truths are too much to bear, T'Challa.",MALE
445,T'CHALA,That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?,MALE
446,ZURI,I promised the King to say nothing.,MALE
447,T'CHALA,I am your King now!,MALE
448,ZURI,Your uncle took a War Dog assignment in America. Your father placed me there to observe unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child. The hardships he saw there radicalized your uncle.,MALE
449,N'JOBU,"I observed for as long as I could! Their leaders have been assassinated, communities flooded with drugs and weapons, they are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the planet our people suffer because they don't have the tools to fight back. With vibranium weapons they could overthrow every country and Wakanda could rule them all, the right way...",MALE
450,ZURI,"He knew your father would not support this, so your uncle betrayed us.",MALE
451,T'CHALA,No...,MALE
452,ZURI,He helped Klaue steal the vibranium.,MALE
453,T'CHALA,No no no no no no...,MALE
454,T'CHALA,"You will return home at once, where you will face the council and inform them of your crimes.",MALE
455,ZURI,He drew his weapon on me.,MALE
456,ZURI,Your father killed his own brother...,MALE
457,ZURI,To save my life.,MALE
458,T'CHALA,Speak nothing of this.,MALE
459,T'CHALA,And the child...,MALE
460,ZURI,We left him.,MALE
461,ZURI,We had to maintain the lie.,MALE
462,W'KABI,What is this?,MALE
463,KILLMONGER,Just a 'lil gift.,MALE
464,W'KABI,Who are you?,MALE
465,ROSS,"Alright, where am I?",MALE
466,SHURI,"Don't scare me like that, colonizer.",FEMALE
467,ROSS,Colon-who? My name is Everett.,MALE
468,SHURI,"Yes, I know. Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA.",FEMALE
469,ROSS,Right.,MALE
470,ROSS,"Ok, is this Wakanda?",MALE
471,SHURI,"No, it's Kansas.",FEMALE
472,ROSS,...How long ago was Korea?,MALE
473,SHURI,Yesterday.,FEMALE
474,ROSS,I don't think so. Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.,MALE
475,SHURI,"They do here. But not by magic, by technology.  Don't touch anything. My brother will return soon.",FEMALE
476,ROSS,"These train things... that's magnetic levitation, right?",MALE
477,SHURI,Obviously.,FEMALE
478,ROSS,"Obviously... but I've never seen it this efficient. The light panels, what are they?",MALE
479,SHURI,Sonic stabilizers.,FEMALE
480,ROSS,Sonic what?,MALE
481,SHURI,"In it's raw form, vibranium is too dangerous to be transported at that speed, so I developed a way to temporarily deactivate it.",FEMALE
482,ROSS,There's vibranium on those trains?,MALE
483,SHURI,There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you.,FEMALE
484,OKOYE,Where is T'Challa? His Kimoyo beads have been switched off.,FEMALE
485,SHURI,"Well we are not joined at the hip, Okoye.",FEMALE
486,OKOYE,A man showed up at the border who claims to have killed Klaue.,FEMALE
487,SHURI,What?,FEMALE
488,OKOYE,W'Kabi is transporting him as we speak to the palace. We need to find your brother.,FEMALE
489,SHURI,An outsider?,FEMALE
490,OKOYE,"No, a Wakandan.",FEMALE
491,ROSS,He's not a Wakandan. He's one of ours.,MALE
492,T'CHALA,He killed his own brother... and left a child behind with nothing. What kind of King ... what kind of man does that?,MALE
493,NAKIA,No man is perfect. Not even your father.,FEMALE
494,T'CHALA,"He didn't even give him a proper burial... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father may have created something even worse.",MALE
495,NAKIA,Hey. Look at me. You can't let your father's mistakes define who you are. You get to decide what kind of King you are going to be.,FEMALE
496,SHURI,"Brother, you need to get here now.",FEMALE
497,ROSS,Eric Stevens. Graduated Annapolis age 19. MIT for grad school. Joined the SEALs and went to Afghanistan where he racked up confirmed kills like it was a video game. They started calling him Killmonger. He joined a JSOC ghost unit.,MALE
498,ROSS,Now these guys are serious. They will drop off the grid so they can commit assassinations and take down governments.,MALE
499,T'CHALA,Did he reveal anything about his identity?,MALE
500,SHURI,He has a War Dog tattoo but we have no record of him.,FEMALE
501,RIVER TRIBE ELDER,Is this man Wakandan or not?,MALE
502,MINING TRIBE ELDER,Tell us what is going on.,FEMALE
503,T'CHALA,Speak.,MALE
504,W'KABI,Speak.,MALE
505,KILLMONGER,I'm standing in your house. Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people. Justice your King couldn't deliver.,MALE
506,T'CHALA,"I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are... now what do you want?",MALE
507,KILLMONGER,I want the throne.,MALE
508,MINING TRIBE ELDER,My goodness.,FEMALE
509,KILLMONGER,"Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good. There's about billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder, Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all.",MALE
510,T'CHALA,And what tools are those?,MALE
511,KILLMONGER,Vibranium. Your weapons.,MALE
512,T'CHALA,Our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own.,MALE
513,KILLMONGER,"Not your own? But didn't life start here, on this continent? So ain't all people your people?",MALE
514,T'CHALA,I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you.,MALE
515,RAMONDA,"Son, we have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request.",FEMALE
516,KILLMONGER,"Oh, I ain't requesting nothing! Ask who I am?",MALE
517,SHURI,You are Eric Stevens. An American black operative. A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are.,FEMALE
518,KILLMONGER,"That's not my name, Princess. Ask me, King?",MALE
519,T'CHALA,No.,MALE
520,KILLMONGER,Ask me.,MALE
521,T'CHALA,Take him away.,MALE
522,RIVER TRIBE ELDER,Who are you?,MALE
523,KILLMONGER,"I am N'Jadaka, son of Prince N'Jobu.",MALE
524,MINING TRIBE ELDER,The son of N'Jobu?,FEMALE
525,KILLMONGER,I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest. You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer!,MALE
526,RAMONDA,You're lying!  Lies.,FEMALE
527,W'KABI,I'm afraid not Queen Mother.,MALE
528,MINING TRIBE ELDER,The descendant of N'Jobu.,FEMALE
529,KILLMONGER,Hey Auntie.,MALE
530,KILLMONGER,I'm exercising my blood right to challenge for the mantles of King and Black Panther. ,MALE
531,RAMONDA,Do not do this T'Challa.,FEMALE
532,BORDER TRIBE ELDER,As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights.,MALE
533,RAMONDA,He has no rights here.,FEMALE
534,RIVER TRIBE ELDER,The challenge would take weeks to prepare.,MALE
535,KILLMONGER,Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him... and somebody to get me out of these chains.,MALE
536,RAMONDA,"T'Challa, what do you know of this?",FEMALE
537,T'CHALA,I accept your challenge.,MALE
538,SHURI,He will never beat T' Challa. He should have just come to the first challenge and gotten it over with.,FEMALE
539,ZURI,The King will now have the strength of the Black Panther stripped away.,MALE
540,OKOYE,Where is Agent Ross?,FEMALE
541,NAKIA,I locked him in the office. He's not going anywhere.,FEMALE
542,T'CHALA,"This is your last chance, throw down your weapons and we can handle this another way.",MALE
543,KILLMONGER,"I lived my entire life waiting for this moment. I trained, I lied, I killed, just to get here.",MALE
544,KILLMONGER,"I killed in America, Afghanistan, Iraq. I took life from my own brothers and sisters right here on the continent. And all this death, just so I can kill you.",MALE
545,ZURI,Let the challenge begin.,MALE
546,T'CHALA,Yield!,MALE
547,SHURI,Snap out of it T'Challa!,FEMALE
548,NAKIA,Get up.,FEMALE
549,KILLMONGER,This is for my father.,MALE
550,T'CHALA,"Zuri, no.",MALE
551,OKOYE,Zuri.,FEMALE
552,RAMONDA,Zuri don't!,FEMALE
553,ZURI,I am the cause of your father's death. Not him. Take me.,MALE
554,KILLMONGER,"I'll take you both, Uncle James...",MALE
555,T'CHALA,Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo!,MALE
556,KILLMONGER,Is this your King? Huh?,MALE
557,KILLMONGER,"Is this your King? The Black Panther, who's supposed to lead you into the future.",MALE
558,SHURI,Come on brother!,FEMALE
559,AYO,Is there nothing that can be done?,MALE
560,KILLMONGER,Him? He's supposed to protect you.,MALE
561,RAMONDA,No.,FEMALE
562,NAKIA,No!,FEMALE

564,NAKIA,"We have to go now! Queen mother, let's go!",FEMALE
565,OKOYE,The Queen Mother and Shuri... they are safe?,FEMALE
566,NAKIA,Yes.,FEMALE
567,OKOYE,Thank you.,FEMALE
568,NAKIA,We should get to them immediately.,FEMALE
569,OKOYE,I cannot...,FEMALE
570,NAKIA,What...,FEMALE
571,OKOYE,Though my heart is with you.,FEMALE
572,NAKIA,We cannot turn over our nation to a man who showed up here only hours ago.,FEMALE
573,OKOYE,He is of royal blood.,FEMALE
574,NAKIA,He killed T' Challa.,FEMALE
575,OKOYE,In ritual combat.,FEMALE
576,NAKIA,Does that really matter?,FEMALE
577,NAKIA,You are the greatest warrior Wakanda has. Help me overthrow him before he becomes too strong.,FEMALE
578,OKOYE,"Overthrow?! Nakia, I am not a spy who can come and go as they so choose. I am loyal to the throne, no matter who sits upon it. What are you loyal to?",FEMALE
579,NAKIA,I loved him. I love my country too.,FEMALE
580,OKOYE,Then you serve your country.,FEMALE
581,NAKIA,No. I save my country.,FEMALE
582,ROSS,What's wrong?,MALE
583,NAKIA,"The King is dead. Come with me, unless you want to join him.",FEMALE
584,SHURI,"First Baba, and now my brother. Mama, we didn't even get to bury him.",FEMALE
585,NAKIA,It's me.,FEMALE
586,RAMONDA,Nakia. Who is this man?,FEMALE
587,NAKIA,He's a friend of T' Challa's he saved my life.,FEMALE
588,RAMONDA,Where is Okoye?,FEMALE
589,NAKIA,Okoye is not corning. She and Dora Milaje will serve the new King.  Wait here.,FEMALE
590,RAMONDA,What has happened to our Wakanda?,FEMALE
591,SHAMAN,Allow the Heart Shaped Herb to give you the powers of the Black Panther and take you to the Ancestral Plane.,FEMALE
592,N'JOBU,What did I tell you about going into my things?  What did you find?,MALE
593,KILLMONGER,Your home.,MALE
594,N'JOBU,I gave you a key hoping that you might see it someday.,MALE
595,N'JOBU,Yes. The sunsets there are the most beautiful in the world. But I fear you still may not be welcome.,MALE
596,KILLMONGER,Why?,MALE
597,N'JOBU,They will say you are lost.,MALE
598,KILLMONGER,"But, I'm right here.",MALE
599,N'JOBU,No tears for me?,MALE
600,KILLMONGER,Everybody dies. It's just life around here.,MALE
601,N'JOBU,Well look at what I have done. I should have taken you back long ago.,MALE
602,N'JOBU,"Instead, we are both abandoned here.",MALE
603,KILLMONGER,Well maybe your home is the one that's lost. That's why they can't find us.,MALE
604,SHAMAN,"Breathe, my King. Breathe!",FEMALE
605,KILLMONGER,The Heart Shaped Herb did that?,MALE
606,KILLMONGER,This is all of it?,MALE
607,SHAMAN,"Yes. So when it comes time for another King, we will be ready.",FEMALE
608,KILLMONGER,Another King... yea go ahead and burn all that.,MALE
609,SHAMAN,"My King, we cannot do that. It is our tradition --",FEMALE
610,KILLMONGER,"When I tell you to do something, I mean that shit. Burn it all!",MALE
611,KILLMONGER,"You know, where I'm from, when black folks started revolutions, they never had the firepower or resources to fight their oppressors. Where was Wakanda? Hmm? Yea all that ends today. We got spies embedded in every nation on Earth. Already in place.",MALE
612,KILLMONGER,"I know how colonizers think. So we're gonna use their own strategy against them. We're gonna send vibranium weapons out to our War Dogs. They'll arm oppressed people all over the world, so they can finally rise up and kill those in power, and their children and anyone else who takes their side. It's time they know the truth about us. We're warriors. The world's gonna start over and this time we're on top.",MALE
613,KILLMONGER,The sun will never set on the Wakandan Empire.,MALE
614,OKOYE,Wakanda has survived for so long by fighting when only absolutely necessary.,FEMALE
615,W'KABI,"Wakanda has survived in the past this way, yes. But the world is changing, General. Elders, it is getting smaller. The outside world is catching up and soon it will be the conquerors, or the conquered. I'd rather be the former.",MALE
616,KILLMONGER,You heard your orders. Let's get to it.,MALE
617,ROSS,So where are we going again?,MALE
618,NAKIA,We're taking the Heart Shaped Herb to Jabariland.,FEMALE
619,ROSS,"Heart Shaped Herb, what is that?",MALE
620,SHURI,It gives whoever takes it heightened abilities.,FEMALE
621,NAKIA,It's what made T'Challa so strong.,FEMALE
622,RAMONDA,"Nakia. I don't like this. The Herb belongs to us. We may be creating a bigger monster with M'Baku.  Nakia, you should take it yourself.",FEMALE
623,NAKIA,I'm a spy with no army. I wouldn't stand a chance.,FEMALE
624,RAMONDA,We'll go.,FEMALE
625,NAKIA,Stay calm.,FEMALE
626,RAMONDA,My son was murdered in ritual combat.,FEMALE
627,M'BAKU,Were the odds fair?,MALE
628,NAKIA,"Yes, but...",FEMALE
629,M'BAKU,"So, it was less a murder than a defeat?",MALE
630,SHURI,Do not rub our noses in it --,FEMALE
631,M'BAKU,"Silence! I make the pronouncements here, girl.",MALE
632,ROSS,"Look uh, your highness, the new King is a --",MALE
633,M'BAKU,You cannot talk. One more word and I will feed you to my children.,MALE
634,M'BAKU,I'm kidding. We are vegetarians.,MALE
635,NAKIA,Great Gorilla M'Baku. This is why we are here. To offer this to you. An outsider sits on our throne. Only you can help us stop him.,FEMALE
636,M'BAKU,Come with me.,MALE
637,NAKIA,Impossible.  Is he breathing?,FEMALE
638,M'BAKU,"He is in a coma, barely clinging to life.",MALE
639,M'BAKU,One of our fishermen found him at the edge of the river border. He brought him to me. ,MALE
640,SHURI,Why do you have him in the snow?!,FEMALE
641,M'BAKU,It is the only thing keeping him from joining the ancestors.,MALE
642,SHURI,We need to get him to my lab! I can heal him there.,FEMALE
643,M'BAKU,Take him. He' ll be dead in seconds.,MALE
644,RAMONDA,"Nakia, the Herb.",FEMALE
645,RAMONDA,I call upon the ancestors. I call upon Bast. I am here with my son T'Challa. Heal him. We must bury him.,FEMALE
646,RAMONDA,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
647,NAKIA,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
648,ROSS,Praise the ancestors.,MALE
649,SHURI,Praise the ancestors.,FEMALE
650,NAKIA,"Wake up, T'Challa. Wake up.",FEMALE
651,T'CHALA,My son.,MALE
652,T'CHALA,The time has come for you to come home and be reunited with me.,MALE
653,T'CHALA,Why?,MALE
654,T'CHALA,Why didn't you bring the boy home?,MALE
655,T'CHALA,"Why, Baba?",MALE
656,T'CHALA,He... he was the truth I chose to omit.,MALE
657,T'CHALA,You were wrong to abandon him.,MALE
658,T'CHALA,I chose my people. I chose Wakanda. Our future depended on --,MALE
659,T'CHALA,"You were wrong! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of the world. We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right. No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne. He is a monster of our own making. I must take the mantle back, I must. I must right these wrongs.",MALE
660,T'CHALA,Do you have a blanket?,MALE
661,NAKIA,Killmonger has the full support of our military. And he burned the garden of the Heart Shaped Herb.,FEMALE
662,ROSS,Of course he did.,MALE
663,ROSS,That's what he was trained to do. His unit used to work with the CIA to destabilize foreign countries.,MALE
