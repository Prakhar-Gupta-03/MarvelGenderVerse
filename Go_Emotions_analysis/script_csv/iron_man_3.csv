HAPPY HOGAN,Why?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.",MALE

TONY STARK,"You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can.

JARVIS,The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.,MALE
TONY STARK,Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.  Nope.  That. You sure that's not one of his?,MALE
JARVIS,It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.,MALE
TONY STARK,Bring her around.,MALE
JARVIS,The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius.,MALE
TONY STARK,"That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?",MALE
JARVIS,Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Are we still at ""ding-dong""? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?",MALE

TONY STARK,"Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.  It's...with her.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"TONY STARK, is somebody there?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.  Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.  Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What...what for? Why now?,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I'll be fine.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.",FEMALE

TONY STARK,What?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Trust me.  We're going out of town.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, we've been through this. Nope.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yep!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,The man says no.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Immediately and indefinitely!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Honey...,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Great idea. Let's go.,FEMALE

PEPPER POTTS,"TONY STARK, this is how normal people behave.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I can't protect you out there. I challenged...,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Is...is that normal?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yes, this is normal!",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Sadly, that...is very normal.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"It's a big bunny, relax about it!",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Calm down!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I got this for you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I'm aware of that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You still haven't even told me that you liked it!,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don't like it!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I asked you three... You don't like it?!,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"TONY STARK, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I said no.,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Guys, can we um...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What?,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Do we need to worry about that?,FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,I got you.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.  Move! I'm right behind!  Get her, I'm gonna find a way around.  Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go!",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Oh my God. Tony!,FEMALE
JARVIS,"Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Jarvis, where's my flight power?!",MALE
JARVIS,"Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.",MALE
TONY STARK,That's one.,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.",MALE
TONY STARK,That's two.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Tony!,FEMALE
JARVIS,"Sir, take a deep breath.  Flight power restored.",MALE
JARVIS,Sir. Sir!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.",MALE
JARVIS,That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent.,MALE
TONY STARK,"It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?",MALE
JARVIS,"We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...",MALE
JARVIS,I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.,MALE
TONY STARK,Who asked you? Open the suit.,MALE
JARVIS,"I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,Open eject.  That's brisk!  Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.,MALE
JARVIS,"I actually think I need to sleep now, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy.",MALE
COMPUTER VOICE,Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.  Let's get you comfy.  You happy now?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Freeze! Don't move.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.  And now you're out of ammo.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,What's that thing on your chest?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.",MALE

HARLEY KEENER,What happened to him?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Like a mechanic?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It's Iron Patriot now.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,That's way cooler!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, it's not.",MALE

TONY STARK,Retroreflective panels?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,To make him stealth mode.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You want a stealth mode?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Cool, right?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Oops!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,S...Sorry.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,What's in it for me?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Salvation. What's his name?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Who?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,How'd you know that?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I got just the thing.  This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.  Deal? Deal? What'd you say?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Deal.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Deal?  What's you're name?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Harley. And you're...,FEMALE

PEPPER POTTS,Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?,FEMALE
MAYA HANSEN,"I think that my boss is working for ALDRICH KILLIAN. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Your boss works for ALDRICH KILLIAN, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...",FEMALE
MAYA HANSEN,"That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"This boss of yours, does he have a name?",FEMALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Yeah, Aldrich Killian.",FEMALE
SAVIN,"Well, we took the house down, sir...",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Mmhmm.,MALE
SAVIN,But there's no sign of a body.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,I see.,MALE
SAVIN,No Stark.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"I have to go.  The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done.  Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.",MALE
MANDARIN LOOK-OUT,The Master is travelling.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Well then. What are we waiting for?,MALE
TONY STARK,"The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Maybe never, relax about it.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space.  What's the official story here? What happened?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Six people died, right?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Including Chad Davis?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah. That doesn't make sense.  Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Do you buy that?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,No idea. I'm not...I don't care.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Are they coming back? The aliens?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Does this subject make you...make you edgy?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Nope.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Do you need to be on it?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Probably.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Do you have PTSD?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I don't think so.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out!  Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"What did I say?  Hey, wait up! Wait, wait.  What the hell was that?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Where she always is.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"See, now you're being helpful.  Sorry.  Lady, this uh...",MALE
BRANDT,Thank you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Nice haircut, suits you.",MALE
BRANDT,Nice watch.,MALE

MRS. DAVIS,Free country.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It sure is.,MALE
MRS. DAVIS,Alright. Where'd you like to start?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.,MALE
MRS. DAVIS,"Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go.  Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?",MALE
MRS. DAVIS,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.",MALE
MRS. DAVIS,What?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,As a weapon.,MALE
MRS. DAVIS,"You're not the person who called me after all, are you?",FEMALE
BRANDT,"Actually, I am.",MALE
ROSE HILLS SHERIFF,"Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?",FEMALE

ROSE HILLS SHERIFF,"Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?",FEMALE
BRANDT,Homeland Security.  We good here?,MALE
ROSE HILLS SHERIFF,"No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.",FEMALE
BRANDT,"Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.",MALE
ROSE HILLS SHERIFF,"Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me?",FEMALE
BRANDT,"Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good.",MALE
ROSE HILLS SHERIFF,"Deputy, get this woman and...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go.  Crazy, huh?",MALE
ROSE HILL CHRISTMAS TREE SHOPPER,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Watch this.   You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you.",MALE
BRANDT,That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Let me go!,FEMALE
SAVIN,"Help me! Help me!  Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!",FEMALE
SAVIN,"Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, ""I want my god damn file.""",MALE
TONY STARK,"It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies.  Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,You're welcome,FEMALE
TONY STARK,For what? Did I miss something?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Me saving your life,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid.  I'm sorry, kid, you did good.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yep  Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,I'm cold.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,It was worth a shot.,FEMALE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL,"Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.",MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,"Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards.  Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.  But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.",MALE
THOMAS RICHARDS,No!,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!",MALE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL,How did he hack my phone?,MALE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL,We can't allow terrorists to dictate...,MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,I have to make this call.,MALE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL,I'd strongly advise against that.,MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,This is the right thing to do.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,"Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.",MALE
MILITARY AIDE,"Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,Right now.,MALE
MILITARY AIDE,"Yes, sir.",MALE

JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?",MALE
TONY STARK,"It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"It's the same as it's always been, ""WarMachine68.""",MALE
TONY STARK,"And password, please.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"It's not the '80s, nobody says ""hack"" any more. Give me your login.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"""WAR MACHINE ROX"" with an ""X,"" all caps.",MALE
TONY STARK,"That is so much better than ""lron Patriot.""",MALE
EMCEE,Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?,MALE
ELK RIDGE,"Well, David...",FEMALE
CREW,Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...,NEUTRAL

GARY,Okay.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.",MALE
GARY,"Oh, good. Can I just say?",MALE
TONY STARK,What do you want?,MALE
GARY,"Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...",MALE
TONY STARK,It's fine.,MALE
GARY,"It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.",MALE
TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
GARY,"I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!",MALE
TONY STARK,A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?,MALE
GARY,"Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...",MALE
TONY STARK,"Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.",MALE
GARY,Got it.,MALE
TONY STARK,All right? It's a mission.,MALE
GARY,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,Tony needs Gary.,MALE

GARY,Yeah.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?,MALE
CHAD DAVIS,"Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Will you please state your name for the camera?,MALE
BRANDT,Ellen Brandt.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here!",MALE
TONY STARK,"A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to ALDRICH KILLIAN. Got you, pal.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.",FEMALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.",FEMALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. ",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Maya, run!",FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hi, Pepper. So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"I've told you, Killian, we can use him.",FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.",FEMALE
MAN,This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Copy.  Nobody move.  Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless ALDRICH KILLIAN's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure.",MALE
WOMAN,Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,"If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.",MALE
WOMAN,"That's the plan, Colonel.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,How much have you had?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Two or three bowls.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Can you still see straight?,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Sort of.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?",MALE
JARVIS,"It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint ALDRICH KILLIAN's broadcast signal.",MALE
TONY STARK,"What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?",MALE
JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it's in Miami.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Um, it does say Miami, Florida.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Uh, it's not charging.",FEMALE
JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.",MALE
TONY STARK,"What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...  Oh, God, not again.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Tony?  Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Okay, um, uh...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"God, what am I gonna do?",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,"Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
HARLEY KEENER,You said so.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yes, I did.",MALE
HARLEY KEENER,Why don't you just build something?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay. Thanks, kid.",MALE
WOMAN,Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.,FEMALE
MAN,"My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con...",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.  Now, which one of you is Vanessa?",MALE
VANESSA,That's me.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?,MALE
VANESSA,There's some guy over here.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.",MALE
TONY STARK,Hey!,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Bloody hell. Bloody hell.,MALE
TONY STARK,Don't move.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.,MALE
TONY STARK,What?,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Heard enough. You're not him. ALDRICH KILLIAN, the real guy. Where? Where's ALDRICH KILLIAN? Where is he?",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.",MALE
TONY STARK,What do you mean?,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.",MALE
TONY STARK,It is?,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,It's complicated.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.,MALE
TONY STARK,"What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.  Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"It's just a role. ""ALDRICH KILLIAN,"" see, it's not real.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Then how did you get here, Trevor?",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Next?,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What did they say? They'd get you off them?,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Did you just nod off? Hey.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"""He""? Killian?",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,Killian.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,He created you?,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,He created me.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Custom-made terror threat.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Westerngraphy. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought ALDRICH KILLIAN to life.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Your performance? Where people died?,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under...",MALE
SAVIN,"Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,I didn't tell him anything.,FEMALE
SAVIN,Nothing?,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,No.,FEMALE
SAVIN,You should have pressed the panic button.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Ah...  Okay.,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"It's just like old times, huh?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,It wasn't my idea.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Okay. So you took Killian's card.,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,I took his money.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,No.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah?,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I'm telling you it isn't.  I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Then help me fix it.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Did I do that?,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Yes.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,You don't remember?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.""",MALE
TONY STARK,"You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.",MALE
TONY STARK,You're something else.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You have met him, I assume?",MALE
TONY STARK,Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.",MALE
TONY STARK,What's next for you in your world?,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.  Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,Let him go.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hold on, hold on. Maya...",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"I said, let him go.",FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,What are you doing?,MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.",FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,"If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?",FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"We're not doing this, okay?",MALE
MAYA HANSEN,What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.",MALE
TONY STARK,You are a maniac.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight.  Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.",MALE
SAVIN,"Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Afternoon, gentlemen.  Hello, Colonel. Step aside.  Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.",MALE
SAVIN,You'll damage the armour.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.",MALE
SAVIN,She's still in Phase Two.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You're not going deaf, are you?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?",MALE
GUARD,832 miles.,MALE
TONY STARK,Very nice.,MALE
GUARD,"I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Break it, you bought it.",MALE
GUARD,I think I bought it.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.",MALE
GUARD,What are you gonna do to me?,MALE
TONY STARK,You'll see.,MALE
GUARD,You're zip-tied to a bed. This.  That.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Are you coming out?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.  All right. Let's go.  You... You breathe fire? Okay.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...",MALE
GUARD,How did we get this shift?,MALE
TONY STARK,"All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!",MALE
GUARD,Wow. That was...,MALE
TONY STARK,You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.,MALE
GUARD,I am just beyond terrified.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Here it comes. Three, four...",MALE
GUARD,Shut up.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Five, four, three, two, one!  Told you. Where's the rest?  Where's the rest?",MALE
MAN,"Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Ah! Better late than never.  Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.",MALE
JARVIS,"Oh, hello, sir.",MALE
GUARD,"All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Ah! Let's go!  Aw, crap.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Tony?,MALE
TONY STARK,"JAMES RHODES, tell me that was you in the suit.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,No. You got yours'?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You, you, you! Move! Get out!",MALE
TONY STARK,The room is secure. I have eyes on ALDRICH KILLIAN.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,What's this? I had winners.,MALE
TONY STARK,What have you come as?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You make a move, and I break your face.",MALE
TONY STARK,I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,This is ALDRICH KILLIAN?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Spill.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Do you know what they did to my suit?,MALE
TONY STARK,What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.,MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Woah!  Ole', ole', ole', ole'...",FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,"TONY STARK, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, a little bit.",MALE
TONY STARK,So?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Right.  Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?",MALE
TONY STARK,Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.,MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,Thanks. Hello?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Sir, this is Tony Stark.",MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,Welcome back to the land of the living.,MALE
TONY STARK,We believe you're about to be drawn into ALDRICH KILLIAN campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.,MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,"Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.",MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,"Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Rhodes and Stark out.,MALE
MAN,"Everything okay, sir?",MALE
VICE PRESIDENT,"Couldn't be better. I love you, babe.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,"Colonel Rhodes.  Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.",MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.",MALE
TONY STARK,And what about the suit I'm wearing?,MALE
JARVIS,The armour is now at 92%.,MALE
TONY STARK,That's going to have to do.,MALE
MILITARY AIDE,"Everything all right, Colonel?",MALE
SAVIN,"It is an honour, Mr President.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,"If you're gonna do it, do it!",MALE
SAVIN,"Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how ALDRICH KILLIAN works.",MALE
OFFICER,"Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.",MALE
OFFICER,Get me eyes on it now.,MALE
OFFICER,"Image coming through now, sir.",MALE
OFFICER,Was that Rhodes?,MALE
MAN,Is anyone there?,MALE
WOMAN,Let us out!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,The President. Now.,MALE
SAVIN,"He's not here.  Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.  How many in the air?",MALE
JARVIS,"Thirteen, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,How many can I carry?,MALE
JARVIS,"Four, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?",MALE
HEATHER,"Oh, God! No! No!",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?",MALE
HEATHER,What? Oh!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.",MALE
JARVIS,"18,000 feet.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.",MALE
JARVIS,"10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!",MALE
JARVIS,"1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,"He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello.",MALE
MAN,We made it!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...  That came out of nowhere. Wow",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Give me some good news, man.",MALE
TONY STARK,I think they all made it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Oh, thank God.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but I missed the president.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?",MALE
JARVIS,"The House Party Protocol, sir?",MALE
TONY STARK,Correct.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Hi.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You think he's gonna help you? He won't.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Trophy,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Mmm.  Good evening, sir.  Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,This is the Roxxon Norco.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,What do you want from me?,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,Hey!,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?",MALE
TONY STARK,I hope not.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Oh, my God.  He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.",MALE
TONY STARK,Viking funeral. Public execution.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, death by oil.",MALE
ANNOUNCER,Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,ls your gun up?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yep. What do I do?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Six, high, back. Alright.  You see that? Nailed it.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, you really killed the glass.",MALE
TONY STARK,You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance.,MALE
ANNOUNCER,"All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.",MALE
MAN,Over there!,MALE
ANNOUNCER,"I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.",MALE
TONY STARK,I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"They're not universal, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Okay,MALE
TONY STARK,Give me one of yours.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,I don't have one that fits that gun.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,What'd you see?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Too fast. Nothing. Here we go.  Three guys, one girl, all armed.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"God, I would kill for some armour right now.",MALE
TONY STARK,You're right. We need backup.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, a bunch.",MALE
TONY STARK,You know what?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Is that...?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yep.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Are those...?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah.  Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.",MALE
JARVIS,"Yes, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.,MALE
JARVIS,Gentlemen.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?  Nice timing.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,What does that mean?,MALE
TONY STARK,I got you covered.,MALE
JARVIS,"Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Very funny.,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, I've located Ms Potts.",MALE
TONY STARK,About time.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You're such a jerk.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.  Come on. A little more, baby.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there?  Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Tony.,FEMALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, you take a minute.  Jarvis, give me a suit right now!  Oh, come on!",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on.  Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.",MALE
TONY STARK,Nice work.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Ready, sir?",MALE
PRESIDENT ELLIS,"What do you mean ""ready""?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No!",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,A shame. I would've caught her.,MALE
TONY STARK,Eject.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, here we are on the roof.",MALE
JARVIS,"Mark 42, inbound.",MALE
TONY STARK,I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.  Whatever.,MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.  Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.",MALE
ALDRICH KILLIAN,"No!  No more false faces. You said you wanted ALDRICH KILLIAN. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am ALDRICH KILLIAN!",MALE
TONY STARK,"I got nothing.  Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?  Honey?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, my God. That was really violent.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, don't touch me.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Don't worry about it.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, I'm gonna burn you.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, you're not. Not hot.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Am I gonna be okay?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,And all your distractions?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.,MALE
JARVIS,"All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?",MALE
TONY STARK,You know what to do.,MALE
JARVIS,"The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.  Okay, so far? Do you like it?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,It'll do.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.",MALE
TREVOR SLATTERY,"Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"But then I thought to myself, ""Why stop there?"" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you, that was the best sleep I'd had in years.",MALE
NURSE,It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"No, look.",MALE
TONY STARK,"So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man.  You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.",MALE
TONY STARK,"To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.  And the fact that you've been able to -help me process...  Are you with me?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...",MALE
TONY STARK,Are you actively napping?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I was... I... I drifted.,MALE
TONY STARK,Where did I lose you?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Elevator in Switzerland.,MALE
TONY STARK,"So, you heard none of it?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.,MALE
TONY STARK,So?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don't have the...,MALE
TONY STARK,What? The time?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Temperament.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Yes.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.",MALE
