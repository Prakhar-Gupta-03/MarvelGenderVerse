ASGARDIAN PA,"This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.  Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft!",MALE
EBONY MAW,"Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile...  for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.",MALE
THANOS,"I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.",MALE
THOR,You talk too much.,MALE
THANOS,"The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.",MALE
LOKI,"Oh, I do. Kill away!",MALE
LOKI,"ALL RIGHT, STOP!",MALE
THOR,We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.,MALE
THOR,You really are the worst brother.,MALE
LOKI,"I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.",MALE
THANOS,"Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.",MALE
LOKI,"Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.",MALE
EBONY MAW,Let him have his fun.,MALE
HEIMDALL,Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.,MALE
THANOS,That was a mistake.,MALE
THOR,NO!!!  You're going to die for that!,MALE
EBONY MAW,Shh.,MALE
EBONY MAW,"My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.",MALE
THANOS,"There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.",MALE
PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,"Father, we will not fail you.",FEMALE
CULL OBSIDIAN,"We're going to New York City and We will tear The Avengers Apart and Smash! Once and for all, my lord.",MALE
LOKI,"If I might interject… if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.",MALE
THANOS,If you consider failure experience.,MALE
LOKI,"I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard...  Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.",MALE
THANOS,"""Undying?"" You should choose your words more carefully.",MALE
LOKI,You will... never be... a god.,MALE
THOR,NO!,MALE
THANOS,No resurrections this time.,MALE
THOR,No… Loki….,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Seriously? You don't have any money?,MALE
WONG,Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I'll tell the guys at the deli.  Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.,MALE
WONG,"Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Dollars?,MALE
WONG,Rupees.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Which is?,MALE
WONG,"Uh, buck and a half.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,What do you want?,MALE
WONG,I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Thanos is coming. He's coming...,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Who?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You're totally rambling.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, I'm not.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Lost me.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yeah. Everybody has that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Right.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Morgan! Morgan.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"So you woke up, and thought that we were...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Expecting.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,No.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I had a dream about it. It was so real.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"It's not helping your case, OK?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You don't need that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Shirts?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You should have shirts in your closet.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yes.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I will.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.",MALE
TONY STARK,"And who's ""we""?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Hey, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,Bruce.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Pepper.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Hi.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You okay?,MALE
WONG,"From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.,MALE
TONY STARK,Tell me his name again.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.",MALE
TONY STARK,This is it... What's our timeline?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Did you seriously just say ""hitherto undreamt of""?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?,MALE
TONY STARK,Is that what this is.... ?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,No can do.,MALE
WONG,We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.,MALE
TONY STARK,"And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Stark Raving Hazelnuts.,MALE
TONY STARK,It's not bad.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,A bit chalky.,MALE
WONG,A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,That's a thing?,MALE
TONY STARK,Whatever. Point is: things change.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.,MALE
TONY STARK,"And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Well, if we don't do our jobs.",MALE
TONY STARK,"What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Protecting your reality, douchebag.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, that's the... thing.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,What do you mean?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"What? Tony, you lost another super bot?",MALE
TONY STARK,I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Who could find Vision, then?",MALE
TONY STARK,Shit.  Probably Steve Rogers.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Oh, great.",MALE
TONY STARK,Maybe. But...,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Call him.,MALE
TONY STARK,"It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,No.,MALE
TONY STARK,The Avengers broke up. We're toast.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?,MALE
TONY STARK,Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Not at the moment, no.",MALE
TONY STARK,You okay?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Help him! Wong, Doc.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Go! Got it!,MALE
TONY STARK,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?",MALE
FRIDAY,"Not sure, I'm working on it.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Might wanna use it.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.",MALE
NED LEEDS,Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!,MALE
STAN LEE,What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?,MALE
TONY STARK,"F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.",MALE
FRIDAY,Will do.,MALE
EBONY MAW,"Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...",MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.",MALE
EBONY MAW,Stonekeeper...  Does this chattering animal speak for you?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Certainly not. I speak for myself.  But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet.,MALE
TONY STARK,"It means get lost, Squidward!",MALE
EBONY MAW,He exhausts me.,MALE
EBONY MAW,Bring me the Stone.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Banner, you want a piece?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?",MALE
TONY STARK,That's right.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.",MALE
TONY STARK,Where's your guy?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.,MALE
TONY STARK,There's no time for a thing.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I know.,MALE
TONY STARK,That's the thing right there. Let's go.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't--",MALE
TONY STARK,"It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.",MALE
WONG,I have him.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Damn it.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Where'd that come from?,MALE
TONY STARK,It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....",MALE
TONY STARK,"Gotta get that stone outta here, now.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,It stays with me.,MALE
TONY STARK,Exactly. Bye.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I'm trying. He won't come out.,MALE
TONY STARK,Hammer.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me?  Come out! Come out! Come out!",MALE
HULK,Nooooooo!,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"What do you mean, ""no""?!",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Kid, where'd you come from?",MALE
PETER PARKER,Field trip to MoMA.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?",MALE
TONY STARK,He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.,MALE
EBONY MAW,Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.,MALE
EBONY MAW,Then I'll take it off your corpse.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.,MALE
EBONY MAW,You'll only wish you were dead.  NO!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.",MALE
PETER PARKER,On it!,MALE
PETER PARKER,Not cool!,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hang on, kid.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wong, you're invited to my wedding.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.",MALE
PETER PARKER,But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!,MALE
TONY STARK,You're too high up. You're running out of air.,MALE
PETER PARKER,Yeah! That makes sense.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!",MALE
TONY STARK,"Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.",MALE
FRIDAY,Yep.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"OH, COME ON!",MALE
FRIDAY,"Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Why?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Tell me you're not on that ship.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.",MALE

TONY STARK,Pep….,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Come back here right now! Come back!,FEMALE
FRIDAY,"Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too….",MALE
PETER PARKER,Oh my God!  I should have stayed on the bus....,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Where you going?,MALE
WONG,The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I'm gonna make a call.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Sing it, Drax!",MALE
ROCKET,Why are we doing this again?,MALE
GAMORA,"It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.",MALE
ROCKET,"I get that, but why are we doing it?",MALE
PETER QUILL,Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese  for our help.,MALE
GAMORA,Which isn't the point.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….,MALE
DRAX,We'll take his ship.,MALE
ROCKET,Exactly!,MALE
PETER QUILL,B-b-b-bingo!,MALE
MANTIS,We are arriving.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again.  Groot.",MALE
GROOT,I am Groot!,MALE
PETER QUILL,Whoa!,MALE
ROCKET,Language!,MALE
GAMORA,Hey!,MALE
DRAX,Wow.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"You got some acorns on you, kid.",MALE
ROCKET,"Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!",MALE
MANTIS,What happened?,MALE
ROCKET,Looks like we're not getting paid.,MALE
ROCKET,Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!,MALE
PETER QUILL,How the hell is this dude still alive?,MALE
DRAX,"He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.",MALE
PETER QUILL,I'm muscular.,MALE
ROCKET,"Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"Yeah, right.",MALE
DRAX,It's true. You have gained a little weight….,MALE
PETER QUILL,"What? Gamora, do you think I'm…",MALE
MANTIS,He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.,MALE
DRAX,It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.,MALE
ROCKET,"You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?",MALE
GAMORA,It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Stop massaging his muscles.  Wake him up.,MALE
MANTIS,Wake.,MALE
THOR,Who the hell are you guys?,MALE
GAMORA,"The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....",MALE
DRAX,Including my own.,MALE
GAMORA,"If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.",MALE
THOR,You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.,MALE
DRAX,Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.,MALE
THOR,Your father killed my brother.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.",MALE
THOR,"Families can be tough.  Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--",MALE
THOR,"I need a hammer, not a spoon…. How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….",MALE
PETER QUILL,What are you doing?,MALE
THOR,Taking your pod.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.",MALE
ROCKET,Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?,MALE
PETER QUILL,No.,MALE
DRAX,You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.,MALE
PETER QUILL,No I'm not.,MALE
MANTIS,He just did it again!,MALE
PETER QUILL,This is my voice!,MALE
THOR,Are you mocking me?,MALE
PETER QUILL,Are you mocking me?,MALE
THOR,Stop it. You did it again.,MALE
PETER QUILL,He's trying to copy me.,MALE
THOR,Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.,MALE
GAMORA,Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.,MALE
THOR,Knowhere.,MALE
MANTIS,He must be going somewhere.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.",MALE
THOR,Not anymore.,MALE
GAMORA,Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?,MALE
THOR,"Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.",MALE
THOR,Or a genius.,MALE
GAMORA,How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?,MALE
THOR,"There's six stones out there.  Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.",MALE
PETER QUILL,The 'Avengers'?,MALE
THOR,Earth's Mightiest Heroes.,MALE
MANTIS,Like Kevin Bacon?,MALE
THOR,"He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.",MALE
GAMORA,Then we have to go to Knowhere now.,MALE
THOR,"Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.",MALE
DRAX,That's a made up word.,MALE
THOR,All words are made up.,MALE
ROCKET,"Hold up, Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend.  They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.",MALE
THOR,"The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.",MALE
ROCKET,Rabbit?,MALE
THOR,"Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?",MALE
ROCKET,You're very perceptive.,MALE
THOR,You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?,MALE
ROCKET,"Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.",MALE
THOR,Wonderful.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Except for that I'm the captain.,MALE
THOR,Quiet!,MALE
PETER QUILL,That's my backpack.,MALE
ROCKET,Go sit down.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to…  Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?",MALE
THOR,The Thanos killing kind.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?,MALE
THOR,No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.,MALE
ROCKET,Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?,MALE
THOR,A little bit. Yeah.,MALE
GAMORA,"If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.",MALE
THOR,He already is.,MALE
ROCKET,"I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.",MALE
THOR,So cool.,MALE
PETER QUILL,For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.,MALE
ROCKET,"You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.",MALE
THOR,"I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis? Is it the stone again?,FEMALE
VISION,It's as if it's speaking to me.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What does it say?,FEMALE
VISION,I don't... I don't know. But something...,MALE
VISION,Tell me what you feel.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I just feel you.,FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.,FEMALE
VISION,What if I miss that train?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,There is an 11.,FEMALE
VISION,"What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You gave Stark your word.,FEMALE
VISION,I'd rather give it to you.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.",FEMALE
VISION,"Not to each other.  Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know.  You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,It works.,FEMALE
VISION,It works.,MALE
VISION,Then stay. Stay with me.,MALE
VISION,Or not. If I'm overstepping…,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What are they?,FEMALE
VISION,What the stone was warning me about.  I have to go.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.",FEMALE
VISION,"Wanda, I…",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vision!,FEMALE
VISION,The blade. It stopped me from phasing.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that even possible?,FEMALE
VISION,It isn't supposed to be.  My systems are failing.  I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Vis!,FEMALE
CORVUS GLAIVE,"Give up the Stone, and she lives.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Hands off.,FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.",FEMALE
VISION,Please. Please leave.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.,FEMALE
VISION,Please.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get up.,FEMALE
PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,Get up.,FEMALE
CORVUS GLAIVE,I can't.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We don't wanna kill you. But we will.,FEMALE
PROXIMA MIDNIGHT,You'll never get the chance again.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Can you stand?,MALE
VISION,"Thank you, Captain.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Let's get you on the jet.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.",FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'm sorry. We just wanted time.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Where to, Cap?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Home.,MALE
GAMORA'S MOTHER,Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.,FEMALE
EBONY MAW,Zehobereians…,MALE
GAMORA,Mother! Where's my mother?!,MALE
EBONY MAW,"Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.",MALE
GAMORA,Mother!,MALE
EBONY MAW,"One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.",MALE
THANOS,"What's wrong, little one?",MALE
GAMORA,My mother. Where is my mother?,MALE
THANOS,What's your name?,MALE
GAMORA,Gamora.,MALE
THANOS,"You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other…  Here. You try.",MALE
EBONY MAW,"Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.",MALE
THANOS,Concentrate. There! You've got it.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the ""blow off your junk"" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--",MALE
GAMORA,I need to ask a favor.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Yeah, sure.",MALE
GAMORA,"One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.",MALE
PETER QUILL,Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?,MALE
GAMORA,If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.,MALE
PETER QUILL,What?,MALE
GAMORA,I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.,MALE
PETER QUILL,What do you know?,MALE
GAMORA,"If I tell you, you'd know, too.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"If it's so important, shouldn't I?",MALE
GAMORA,Only if you wanna die.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?,MALE
GAMORA,"Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"I mean, I'd like to. I really would…",MALE
GAMORA,Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Okay.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Dude. How long have you been standing there?,MALE
DRAX,An hour.,MALE
PETER QUILL,An hour? Are you serious?,MALE
DRAX,I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.,MALE
PETER QUILL,You're eating a zarg-nut.,MALE
DRAX,But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Mmm, no.",MALE
DRAX,I'm sure I'm invisible.,MALE
MANTIS,"Hi, Drax.",MALE
DRAX,Damn it.,MALE
PETER QUILL,This place looks deserted.,MALE
DRAX,I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.",MALE
COLLECTOR,I don't have it.,MALE
THANOS,Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.,MALE
THANOS,"I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.",MALE
COLLECTOR,I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?,MALE
THANOS,I imagine it's like breathing for you.,MALE
COLLECTOR,Like suicide.,MALE
THANOS,So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.,MALE
COLLECTOR,I didn't know what it was.,MALE
THANOS,"Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?",MALE
DRAX,Today...,MALE
PETER QUILL,Drax. Drax.,MALE
DRAX,...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Drax, waaaaait!  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.",MALE
DRAX,No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.,MALE
MANTIS,Sleeeep.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!",MALE
THANOS,Why?  Why you? Daughter…,MALE
PETER QUILL,That was quick.,MALE
COLLECTOR,Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!,MALE
THANOS,"Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.",MALE
THANOS,"That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.",MALE
GAMORA,You knew I'd come.,MALE
THANOS,"I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.",MALE
DRAX,Thanos!,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Let her go, Grimace!",MALE
GAMORA,Peter…,MALE
PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,MALE
GAMORA,Now? Really?,MALE
PETER QUILL,You let her go!,MALE
THANOS,"Ah, the boyfriend.",MALE
PETER QUILL,I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.,MALE
GAMORA,Peter…,MALE
PETER QUILL,Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!,MALE
GAMORA,Not him.,MALE
GAMORA,You promised! You promised.,MALE
THANOS,"Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  DO IT!!",MALE
PETER QUILL,I told you to go right.,MALE
GAMORA,"I love you, more than anything.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"I love you, too.",MALE
THANOS,I like you.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Still no word from Vision?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,You have second thoughts?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Not anymore.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Mr. Secretary.,MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,You got some nerve. I'll give you that.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You could use some of that right now.,FEMALE
SECRETARY ROSS,"The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight.  And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.",MALE
SECRETARY ROSS,Arrest them.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You too, Rhodey.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, I think you look great.  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hi, Bruce.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Nat.,MALE
SAM WILSON,This is awkward.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,And they can clearly find us.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Who's Scott?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Ant-Man.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well then, we have to protect it.",FEMALE
VISION,"No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.",FEMALE
VISION,Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,That's too high a price.,FEMALE
VISION,Only you have the power to pay it.  Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"But it should.  We don't trade lives, Vision.",MALE
VISION,"Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Can we do that?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Not me. Not here.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know somewhere.,MALE
OKOYE,"You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,And the Border Tribe?,MALE
OKOYE,Those that are left.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.,MALE
OKOYE,And what of this one?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,This one may be tired of war.  But the White Wolf has rested long enough.,MALE
BUCKY,Where's the fight?,MALE
T'CHALA,On its way.,MALE
EBONY MAW,"In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement.  Give me... the stone.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....",MALE
TONY STARK,What the--,MALE
PETER PARKER,I know what you're gonna say.,MALE
TONY STARK,You should not be here.,MALE
PETER PARKER,I was gonna go home--,MALE
TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear it.,MALE
PETER PARKER,But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...,MALE
TONY STARK,And now I gotta hear it.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.",MALE
TONY STARK,What did you just say?,MALE
PETER PARKER,I take that back. And now I'm here in space.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah.  Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE
PETER PARKER,No. I did think this through.,MALE
TONY STARK,You could not have possibly thought this through.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.",MALE
TONY STARK,Come on. We got a situation.  See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Um. Okay, okay... uh...  Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?",MALE
EBONY MAW,Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...,MALE
EBONY MAW,...Could end your friend's life in an instant.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.",MALE
EBONY MAW,You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.",MALE
PETER PARKER,Yes! Wait what are those?!,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,We've gotta turn this ship around.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"No, I want to protect the stone.",MALE
TONY STARK,"And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,For what? Nearly blasting me into space?,MALE
TONY STARK,Who just saved your magical ass? Me.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.,MALE
TONY STARK,Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.",MALE
TONY STARK,"And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.",MALE
PETER PARKER,I'm backup.,MALE
TONY STARK,No. You're a stowaway.  The adults are talking.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"No. I'm Peter, by the way.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Dr. Strange.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.",MALE
TONY STARK,This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Can you get us home?,MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.",MALE
THANOS,I thought you might be hungry.,MALE
GAMORA,I always hated that chair.,MALE
THANOS,So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.,MALE
GAMORA,I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.,MALE
THANOS,You told me that too.  Every day. For almost twenty years.,MALE
GAMORA,I was a child when you took me.,MALE
THANOS,I saved you.,MALE
GAMORA,No. No. We were happy on my home planet.,MALE
THANOS,"Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.",MALE
GAMORA,Because you murdered half the planet.,MALE
THANOS,A small price to pay for salvation.,MALE
GAMORA,You're insane.,MALE
THANOS,"Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.",MALE
GAMORA,You don't know that!,MALE
THANOS,"I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.  For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.",MALE
GAMORA,I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.,MALE
THANOS,"And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.",MALE
GAMORA,I'm sorry I disappointed you.,MALE
THANOS,I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it.  But because you did.  And you lied.,MALE
GAMORA,Nebula.,MALE
GAMORA,Don't do this.,MALE
THANOS,"Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.",MALE
GAMORA,Please don't do this.,MALE
THANOS,And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.,MALE
GAMORA,Stop. Stop it.  I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.,MALE
NEBULA,"You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.",FEMALE
GAMORA,He can never get them all.,MALE
NEBULA,He will!,FEMALE
GAMORA,"He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.",MALE
THANOS,You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it.  Where is the Soul Stone?,MALE
GAMORA,Vormir!  The Stone is on Vormir.,MALE
THANOS,Show me.,MALE
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
ROCKET,Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.,MALE
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
THOR,"Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.",MALE
ROCKET,You speak Groot?,MALE
THOR,"Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.",MALE
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
THOR,You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.,MALE
ROCKET,"Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.",MALE
THOR,"Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.",MALE
ROCKET,And you said your sister and your dad?,MALE
THOR,Both dead.,MALE
ROCKET,"Still got a mom, though?",MALE
THOR,Killed by a dark elf.,MALE
ROCKET,A best friend?,MALE
THOR,Stabbed through the heart.,MALE
ROCKET,Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?,MALE
THOR,"Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.",MALE
ROCKET,"Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.",MALE
THOR,"Well, he's never fought me.",MALE
ROCKET,"Yeah, he has!",MALE
THOR,"He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.",MALE
ROCKET,Better be some hammer.,MALE
THOR,"You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.",MALE
ROCKET,And what if you're wrong?,MALE
THOR,If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?,MALE
ROCKET,I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.,MALE
THOR,What's this?,MALE
ROCKET,What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.,MALE
THOR,He gave you his eye?,MALE
ROCKET,He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.,MALE
THOR,"Thank you, sweet rabbit.",MALE
ROCKET,"Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my... Hey, we're here!",MALE
THOR,I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.,MALE
ROCKET,It ain't the eye.,MALE
THOR,Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.,MALE
ROCKET,I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.,MALE
THOR,This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....,MALE
ROCKET,"You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?",MALE
THOR,Yes. Why?,MALE
ROCKET,Look anything like that?,MALE
GROOT,I am Groot.,MALE
THOR,Go back to the pod.,MALE
THOR,"Eitri, wait! Stop!",MALE
EITRI,Thor?,MALE
THOR,What happened here?,MALE
EITRI,You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!,MALE
THOR,"Asgard is destroyed.  Eitri, the glove. What did you do?",MALE
EITRI,"300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.'",MALE
THOR,"Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.",MALE
NEBULA,"Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.",FEMALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, what's going on?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I think we're here.,MALE
TONY STARK,I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Yep, got it.",MALE
TONY STARK,"This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.",MALE
PETER PARKER,Okay. Okay. Ready.,MALE
PETER PARKER,We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!,MALE
TONY STARK,You alright?  That was close. I owe you one.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.",MALE
TONY STARK,I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?,MALE
PETER PARKER,I'm trying to say that... something is coming.,MALE
DRAX,THANOS!!!!,MALE
PETER PARKER,AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Stay down, clown!",MALE
DRAX,"Die, blanket of death!",MALE
PETER QUILL,"Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?",MALE
DRAX,I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!",MALE
DRAX,"Do it, Quill! I can take it.",MALE
MANTIS,"No, he can't take it!",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,She's right. You can't.,MALE
PETER QUILL,Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"Wait, what. Thanos?  Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?",MALE
PETER QUILL,"What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? ""Jesus""?",MALE
TONY STARK,You're from Earth?,MALE
PETER QUILL,I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"So, you're not with Thanos?",MALE
PETER QUILL,"With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?",MALE
PETER PARKER,"We're the Avengers, man.",MALE
PETER QUILL,Oh.,MALE
MANTIS,You're the ones Thor told us about!,MALE
TONY STARK,You know Thor!?,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking,  needed saving.",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,Where is he now?,MALE
ROCKET,This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?,MALE
EITRI,"It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.",MALE
THOR,Did it have a name?,MALE
EITRI,Stormbreaker.,MALE
ROCKET,That's a bit much.,MALE
THOR,So how do we make it?,MALE
EITRI,You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.,MALE
THOR,"Rabbit, fire up the pod.",MALE
PETER QUILL,The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?",MALE
DRAX,"I stopped listening after you said, ""We need a plan.""",MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.",MALE
PETER QUILL,"See, ""not winging it"" isn't really what they do.",MALE
PETER PARKER,"Uh, what exactly is it that they do?",MALE
MANTIS,"Kick names, take ass.",MALE
DRAX,"Yeah, that's right.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?",MALE
PETER QUILL,"""Mr. Lord."" Star-Lord is fine.",MALE
TONY STARK,We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good.",MALE
DRAX,Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.,MALE
TONY STARK,What dance-off?,MALE
PETER QUILL,It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Like in Footloose, the movie?",MALE
PETER QUILL,Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?,MALE
PETER PARKER,It never was.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Don't encourage this, alright?",MALE
PETER PARKER,Okay.,MALE
TONY STARK,We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.,MALE
PETER QUILL,"Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.",MALE
TONY STARK,Your math is blowing my mind.,MALE
MANTIS,"Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Strange, we alright?",MALE
TONY STARK,You're back. You're alright.,MALE
PETER PARKER,"Hey, what was that?",MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.,MALE
PETER QUILL,How many did you see?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,"14,000,605",MALE
TONY STARK,How many did we win?,MALE
STEPHEN STRANGE,One.,MALE
THANOS,The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.,MALE
STONEKEEPER,"Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.",MALE
THANOS,You know us?,MALE
STONEKEEPER,It is my curse to know all who journey here.,MALE
THANOS,Where's the Soul Stone?,MALE
STONEKEEPER,You should know... it extracts a terrible price.,MALE
THANOS,I am prepared.,MALE
STONEKEEPER,We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.,MALE
THANOS,How is it you know this place so well?,MALE
RED SKULL,"A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.",MALE
RED SKULL,What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.,MALE
THANOS,What's this?,MALE
RED SKULL,The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.,MALE
THANOS,Tell me what it needs.,MALE
RED SKULL,To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.,MALE
THANOS,Of what?,MALE
RED SKULL,"In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.",MALE
GAMORA,"All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.",MALE
GAMORA,Really? Tears?,MALE
RED SKULL,They're not for him.,MALE
GAMORA,No! This isn't love!,MALE
THANOS,"I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.  I'm sorry, little one.",MALE
GAMORA,No!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.",MALE
OKOYE,When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,And what did you imagine?,MALE
OKOYE,The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Should we bow?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, he's a king.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,What are you doing?,MALE
T'CHALA,"Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,How we looking?,FEMALE
T'CHALA,"You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...",MALE
BUCKY,"A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"How you been, Buck?",MALE
BUCKY,"Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.",MALE
SHURI,Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.",MALE
SHURI,Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Because, we didn't think of it.",MALE
SHURI,I'm sure you did your best.,FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Can you do it?,FEMALE
SHURI,"Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,How long?,MALE
SHURI,As long as you can give me.,FEMALE
OKOYE,Something's entered the atmosphere.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.",MALE
BUCKY,"God, I love this place.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.",MALE
VISION,It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Vision, get your ass back on the table.",FEMALE
T'CHALA,We will hold them off.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I will.,FEMALE
T'CHALA,Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.,MALE
ROCKET,"I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.",MALE
THOR,Leave that to me.,MALE
ROCKET,"Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--",MALE
THOR,Fire the engines!,MALE
ROCKET,Nnnyah!,MALE
THOR,MORE... POWER... RABBIT!,MALE
EITRI,"Well done, boy.",MALE
THOR,That's Nivadellir!,MALE
EITRI,Damn it.,MALE
ROCKET,"""Damn it""? What's ""damn it""?",MALE
EITRI,The mechanism is crippled.,MALE
THOR,What?,MALE
EITRI,With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.,MALE
