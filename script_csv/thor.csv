115,115,ODIN,"So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.",MALE
116,116,ODIN,"Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire.

135,135,ODIN,The Casket of Ancient Winters belonged to the Jotuns. They believe it's their birthright.,MALE

156,156,THOR,This was to be my day of triumph.,MALE
157,157,LOKI,"It will come. In time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army? ",MALE

164,164,LOKI,Nothing! Thor was making a jest!,MALE
165,165,THOR,The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.,MALE

168,168,FANDRAL,"This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. ",MALE

180,180,THOR,"Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you?",MALE
181,181,LOKI,What?,MALE
182,182,THOR,You are coming with me...,MALE
183,183,LOKI,"Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side. ",MALE

187,187,SIF,I fear we'll live to regret this.,FEMALE
188,188,VOLSTAGG,If we're lucky.,MALE
189,189,THOR,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.,MALE
190,190,VOLSTAGG,That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.,MALE
191,191,FANDRAL,And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.,MALE
192,192,VOLSTAGG,Jest not! He heareth all!,MALE
193,193,FANDRAL,"Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose.",MALE
194,194,VOLSTAGG,Forgive him! He meaneth no offense!,MALE

198,198,LOKI,I'm sorry?,MALE
199,199,HEIMDALL,"The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor. You think you can deceive me? I, who watch all? I, who can sense the flapping of a butterfly's wings a thousand worlds away?",MALE
200,200,HEIMDALL,Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim?,MALE
201,201,FANDRAL,"That was just a bit of a jest, really...",MALE
202,202,LOKI,You must be mistaken. We're not--,MALE
203,203,THOR,"Enough. Heimdall, may we pass?",MALE
204,204,HEIMDALL,"For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened. ",MALE
205,205,THOR,Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned.,MALE
206,206,VOLSTAGG,What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?,MALE
207,207,LOKI,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth.,MALE
208,208,HEIMDALL,"Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. ",MALE

210,210,HEIMDALL,None do.,MALE
211,211,HEIMDALL,All is ready. You may pass.,MALE
212,212,VOLSTAGG,Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?,MALE
213,213,HEIMDALL,To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.,MALE

215,215,THOR,Come on. Don't be bashful.,MALE
216,216,THOR,"Come on, big fella. Up...!",MALE
217,217,VOLSTAGG,This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!,MALE
218,218,FANDRAL,You bathe?,MALE
219,219,HOGUN,We shouldn't be here.,MALE
220,220,THOR,Too late now.,MALE
221,221,FANDRAL,"Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice.",MALE
222,222,LOKI,Perhaps we should wait.,MALE
223,223,THOR,For what?,MALE
224,224,LOKI,To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.,MALE
225,225,VOLSTAGG,"I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part. ",MALE
226,226,THOR,We know all we must. It's time to act.,MALE
227,227,SIF,He's just got to swing his hammer...,FEMALE
228,228,THOR,"It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world? ",MALE

238,238,SIF,"Well, now I'm on board.",FEMALE
239,239,SIF,Where are they?,FEMALE
240,240,THOR,Hiding. As cowards always do.,MALE
241,241,JOTUN,"What is your business here, Asgardian?",MALE
242,242,THOR,I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.,MALE
243,243,JOTUN,Then speak.,MALE
244,244,LAUFEY,"I am Laufey, King of this Realm. ",MALE
245,245,THOR,And I am--,MALE
246,246,LAUFEY,"We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world? ",MALE
247,247,THOR,I demand answers.,MALE
248,248,LAUFEY,"You ""demand?""",MALE
249,249,THOR,How did your people get into Asgard?,MALE

254,254,LAUFEY,"And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man. ",MALE
255,255,THOR,This boy has grown tired of your mockery.,MALE
256,256,LOKI,"Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered. ",MALE
257,257,THOR,"Know your place, brother... ",MALE
258,258,LAUFEY,You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash.,MALE

267,267,VOLSTAGG,"I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge.""",MALE
268,268,FANDRAL,"At this close range? I think ""The Alfheim Lunge"" is a better move. ",MALE

476,476,ODIN,You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.,MALE
477,477,LOKI,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?,MALE
478,478,ODIN,Don't...,MALE
479,479,LOKI,It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.,MALE
480,480,ODIN,Listen...,MALE

515,515,FRIGGA,Make your father proud.,MALE
516,516,JANE,Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night.,FEMALE
517,517,JANE,Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.,FEMALE
518,518,DARCY,And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry.,MALE
519,519,THOR,This drink. I like it.,MALE

985,985,FANDRAL,Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--,MALE
986,986,VOLSTAGG,"As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security! ",MALE
987,987,FANDRAL,"Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?",MALE
988,988,HOGUN,Big stomach. Big mouth.,MALE
