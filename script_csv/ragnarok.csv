0,THOR,"Now I know what you’re thinking. Oh no!  Thor’s in a cage.  How did this happen? Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It’s a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn’t find any. That’s when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.",MALE
1,THOR,How much longer do you think we’ll be here?,MALE
2,SURTUR,"Thor, Son of Odin.",MALE
3,THOR,"Surtur.  Son of a bitch...you’re still alive!  I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago. ",MALE
4,SURTUR,I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.,MALE
5,THOR,"You know, it’s funny you should mention that because I’ve been having these terrible dreams of late.  Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them. ",MALE
6,SURTUR,"Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy-- ",MALE
7,THOR,Hang on.  Hang on.,MALE
8,THOR,I’ll be back around shortly.  I really feel like we were connecting there.,MALE
9,THOR,"Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. ",MALE
10,SURTUR,"My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard’s-- ",MALE
11,THOR,"Oh, hang on.  Give it a second.",MALE
12,THOR,"I swear I’m not even moving, it’s just doing this on its own.  I’m really sorry. Okay, let me get this straight. You’re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you’ll suddenly grow as big as a house-- ",MALE
13,SURTUR,A mountain!,MALE
14,THOR,The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?,MALE
15,SURTUR,Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.,MALE
16,THOR,"Okay, so where is it? This crown? ",MALE
17,SURTUR,"This is my Crown, the source of my power.",MALE
18,THOR,"Oh, that’s a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow. ",MALE
19,SURTUR,It’s a crown.,MALE
20,THOR,"Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.",MALE
21,SURTUR,"But Ragnarok has already begun. You cannot stop it.  I am Asgard’s doom, and so are you.  All will suffer, all will burn.",MALE
22,THOR,"That’s intense.  To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.  But it looks like I’m going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard’s vault. ",MALE
23,SURTUR,You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?,MALE
24,THOR,Because that’s what heroes do.,MALE
25,THOR,"Wait, sorry.  I didn’t time that right.  And, now!",MALE
26,SURTUR,"You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.",MALE
27,THOR,I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out.,MALE
28,THOR,"Heimdall. I know it’s been a while, but I could use a fast exit!",MALE
29,THOR,...Heimdall?,MALE
30,SKURGE,"Heimdall was an idiot.  This job should have made him rich.  Now, the job ain’t easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it’s all mine for the taking. Behold...my stuff. ",MALE
31,SKURGE,"I’m particularly fond of these. I pulled ‘em out of a place on Midgard called Texas.  I even named them. Des and Troy.  You see, when you put them together...they destroy.",MALE
32,THOR,"Heimdall, come on.",MALE
33,THOR,Stay. I’m running short on--,MALE
34,THOR,-options.,MALE
35,THOR,Heimdall?,MALE
36,ASGARDIAN WOMAN,"Skurge, is that important?",FEMALE
37,SKURGE,You girls are in for a treat.,MALE
38,SKURGE,"Girls! Well well, look who decided to pop in.  Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains. ",MALE
39,THOR,Who are you?,MALE
40,SKURGE,Don’t you remember?  I’m Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.,MALE
41,THOR,Right.  Where’s Heimdall?,MALE
42,SKURGE,"That traitor.  No one knows, he’s a fugitive of the throne. ",MALE
43,THOR,Traitor?,MALE
44,SKURGE,"Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial.  Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe.",MALE
45,THOR,Sure.,MALE
46,SKURGE,Hold on.  I’m supposed to announce your arrival.,MALE
47,THOR,What the hell is that?,MALE
48,LOKI,"Oh, brother.  This is it.  I take my leave. ",MALE
49,THOR,"You fool, you didn’t listen! ",MALE
50,LOKI,I’m sorry.,MALE
51,THOR,Lady Sif!  Get help!,MALE
52,ACTOR SIF,Somebody help!,FEMALE
53,LOKI,Sorry for all I’ve done.,MALE
54,THOR,It’s all right.   Hold on.,MALE
55,LOKI,I’m sorry I tried to rule Earth.,MALE
56,THOR,They’d be lucky to have you.,MALE
57,LOKI,I’m sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.  I just couldn’t help myself.,MALE
58,THOR,I know.,MALE
59,LOKI,I’m a trickster.,MALE
60,THOR,So mischievous.,MALE
61,LOKI,Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.,MALE
62,THOR,It was a wonderful joke.,MALE
63,ODIN,Twas indeed hilarious.,MALE
64,THOR,You are the savior of Asgard.,MALE
65,LOKI,Tell my story.,MALE
66,THOR,I will.,MALE
67,LOKI,Build a statue for me.,MALE
68,THOR,We will build a big statue for you.,MALE
69,LOKI,"With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns. ",MALE
70,THOR,I will tell Father what you did here today.,MALE
71,LOKI,I didn’t do it for him.,MALE
72,THOR,Noooooo!!!,MALE
73,ODIN,"And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours.  He fought back those disgusting dark elves.  He brought peace to the realm.",MALE
74,ODIN,"Loki, my boy...‘Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield.",MALE
75,ODIN,"On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard’s savior.  No.  You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool’s heart.",MALE
76,ODIN,Bravo!  Bravo!  Well done.  Bravo.,MALE
77,THOR,Father.,MALE
78,ODIN,"Oh, shit.  My son!  Thor has returned! Greetings my boy.",MALE
79,THOR,It’s an interesting play.  What’s it called?,MALE
80,ODIN,The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.,MALE
81,THOR,"Indeed they should. I like that statue.  A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.  A little less weasely.  Less greasy maybe.",MALE
82,THOR,You know what this is?,MALE
83,ODIN,The skull of Surtur?  That’s a formidable weapon.,MALE
84,THOR,Do me a favor.  Lock this in a vault so it doesn’t turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.,MALE
85,ODIN,"So it’s back to Midgard for you, is it?",MALE
86,THOR,Nope.  I’ve been having this reocurring dream lately. Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins...,MALE
87,ODIN,That’s just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination.,MALE
88,THOR,"Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate.  And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.  Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes. ",MALE
89,ODIN,"Well, it is best to respect our neighbors’ freedom. ",MALE
90,THOR,"Of course, the freedom to be massacred. ",MALE
91,ODIN,"Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself. ",MALE
92,THOR,Watching theatre.,MALE
93,ODIN,"Board meetings, and security council meetings... ",MALE
94,THOR,You really going to make me do it?,MALE
95,ODIN,Do what?,MALE
96,THOR,You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.,MALE
97,THOR,Not even your face.,MALE
98,ODIN,You’ve gone quite mad.  You’ll be executed for this!,MALE
99,THOR,Then I’ll see you on the other side...brother.,MALE
100,LOKI,"Alright, I yield!",MALE
101,SKURGE,Behold!  Thor..Odinson.,MALE
102,LOKI,You had one job!  Just the one.,MALE
103,THOR,Where’s Odin?,MALE
104,LOKI,"You just couldn’t stay away, could you?  Everything was fine without you.  Asgard was prospering.  You’ve ruined everything.  Ask them.",MALE
105,THOR,Where’s father?  Did you kill him?,MALE
106,LOKI,"You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!",MALE
107,LOKI,Ow-ow-ow!  Alright!  I know exactly where he is.,MALE
108,LOKI,"I swear, I left him right here. ",MALE
109,THOR,"Right here on the sidewalk?  Or right there, where the building that’s being demolished?  Great planning. ",MALE
110,LOKI,How was I supposed to know? Can’t see into the future.  I’m not a witch.,MALE
111,THOR,Then why do you dress like one?,MALE
112,LOKI,Hey.,MALE
113,THOR,"I can’t believe you’re alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you. ",MALE
114,LOKI,I’m honored.,MALE
115,COLLEGE GIRL 2,Ask him.,FEMALE
116,COLLEGE GIRL 1,Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?,FEMALE
117,THOR,Sure. Start figuring out where he is.,MALE
118,COLLEGE GIRL 1,"Oh, my god. ",FEMALE
119,COLLEGE GIRL 2,Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.,FEMALE
120,THOR,"She didn’t dump me, you know.  I dumped her.  It was a mutual dumping.",MALE
121,THOR,"What’s this, what are you doing!?",MALE
122,LOKI,This... isn’t me.,MALE
123,THOR,Loki?,MALE
124,STEPHEN STRANGE,Thor Odinson.,MALE
125,STEPHEN STRANGE,God of Thunder.,MALE
126,STEPHEN STRANGE,You can put down the umbrella.,MALE
127,THOR,So earth has wizards now?,MALE
128,STEPHEN STRANGE,The preferred term is “Master of the Mystic Arts.”,MALE
129,THOR,"Alright wizard, who are you?  Why should I care? ",MALE
130,STEPHEN STRANGE,My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you. Take a seat.,MALE
131,STEPHEN STRANGE,Tea?,MALE
132,THOR,I don’t drink tea.,MALE
133,STEPHEN STRANGE,What do you drink?,MALE
134,THOR,Not tea.,MALE
135,STEPHEN STRANGE,So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world.  Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings.,MALE
136,THOR,He’s a worthy inclusion.,MALE
137,STEPHEN STRANGE,Then why bring him here?,MALE
138,THOR,We’re looking for my father.,MALE
139,STEPHEN STRANGE,"So.  If I were to tell you where Odin was, all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard? ",MALE
140,THOR,Promptly.,MALE
141,STEPHEN STRANGE,Great.  Then I’ll help you.,MALE
142,THOR,"If you knew where he was, why didn’t you call me? ",MALE
143,STEPHEN STRANGE,"I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.  Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile. And you don’t have a phone. ",MALE
144,THOR,"No, I don’t have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter.  It’s called an email. ",MALE
145,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Yeah, do you have a computer? ",MALE
146,THOR,"No. What for? Anyway, my father is no longer in exile. So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home. ",MALE
147,STEPHEN STRANGE,Gladly.  He’s in Norway.,MALE
148,STEPHEN STRANGE,I’m just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.,MALE
149,STEPHEN STRANGE,Nope.,MALE
150,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Oh, we don’t need that.",MALE
151,THOR,Will you stop doing that?,MALE
152,STEPHEN STRANGE,I need just one strand of your hair.,MALE
153,THOR,"Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-!",MALE
154,THOR,We could have just walked.,MALE
155,STEPHEN STRANGE,He’s waiting for you.,MALE
156,THOR,All right.,MALE
157,STEPHEN STRANGE,Don’t forget your umbrella.,MALE
158,THOR,Yes.,MALE
159,THOR,Sorry,MALE
160,THOR,I suppose I’ll need my brother back.,MALE
161,STEPHEN STRANGE,"Yeah, right.",MALE
162,LOKI,...I have been falling...for thirty minutes!,MALE
163,STEPHEN STRANGE,You can handle him from here.,MALE
164,THOR,Yeah of course. Thank you very much for your help.,MALE
165,STEPHEN STRANGE,Good luck.,MALE
166,LOKI,Handle me?  Who are you?,MALE
167,THOR,Loki.,MALE
168,LOKI,"..you think you’re some kind of sorcerer? Don’t think for one minute, you second-rate... ",MALE
169,STEPHEN STRANGE,Bye-bye.,MALE
170,THOR,Father?,MALE
171,ODIN,Look at this place. It’s beautiful.,MALE
172,THOR,"Father, it’s us. ",MALE
173,ODIN,My sons.  I’ve been waiting for you.,MALE
174,THOR,I know.  We’ve come to take you home.,MALE
175,ODIN,"Home, yes.  Your mother, she calls me.  Do you hear it?",MALE
176,THOR,"Loki, lift your magic.",MALE
177,ODIN,Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.  Frigga would have been proud.,MALE
178,ODIN,Come and sit with me.  I don’t have much time.,MALE
179,THOR,"I know that we failed you, but we can make this right. ",MALE
180,ODIN,I failed you. It is upon us...Ragnarok.,MALE
181,THOR,"No, I’ve stopped Ragnarok.  I put an end to Surtur. ",MALE
182,ODIN,"No.  It has already begun.  She’s coming.  My life was all that held her back, but my time has come.  I cannot keep her away any longer. ",MALE
183,THOR,"Father, who are you talking about? ",MALE
184,ODIN,The Goddess of Death.  Hela.  My first born. Your sister.,MALE
185,THOR,...what?,MALE
186,ODIN,"Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.  I couldn’t stop her, so I imprisoned her.  Locked her away.  She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless. ",MALE
187,THOR,"Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together. ",MALE
188,ODIN,No we won’t.  I’m on a different path now.  This you must face alone.,MALE
189,ODIN,I love you my sons.,MALE
190,ODIN,Look at that.,MALE
191,ODIN,Remember this place.  Home.,MALE
192,LOKI,Brother.,MALE
193,THOR,This was your doing.,MALE
194,HELA,So he’s gone? That’s a shame.  I would’ve liked to have seen that.,FEMALE
195,THOR,"You must be Hela.  I’m Thor, son of Odin. ",MALE
196,HELA,"Really, you don’t look like him. ",FEMALE
197,LOKI,Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.,MALE
198,HELA,You sound like him.,FEMALE
199,HELA,Kneel.,FEMALE
200,LOKI,Beg your pardon?,MALE
201,HELA,Kneel...before your Queen.,FEMALE
202,THOR,I don’t think so.,MALE
203,THOR,It’s not possible.,MALE
204,HELA,"Darling, you have no idea what’s possible.",FEMALE
205,LOKI,Bring us back!,MALE
206,THOR,No!!,MALE
207,THOR,Loki!,MALE
208,VOLSTAGG,Who are you!?  What have you done with Thor?,MALE
209,HELA,I’m Hela.,FEMALE
210,SKURGE,I’m just a janitor.,MALE
211,HELA,You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.  How would you like a job?,FEMALE
212,LEAD SCRAPPER,Are you a fighter or are you food?,MALE
213,THOR,I’m just passing through.,MALE
214,LEAD SCRAPPER,It is food.  On your knees.,MALE
215,SCRAPPER #142,He’s MINE.,MALE
216,SCRAPPER #142,Wait!,MALE
217,SCRAPPER #142,"Wait!  He’s mine.  So if you want him, you go through me.",MALE
218,SCRAPPER,But we’ve already got him.,MALE
219,SCRAPPER #142,Alright then I guess I go through you.,MALE
220,LEAD SCRAPPER,More food.,MALE
221,THOR,Thank you.,MALE
222,SCRAPPER #142,This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.  I’ve got something special.,MALE
223,THOR,Hey!  Where are you taking me?,MALE
224,THOR,"Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin.  I need to get back to Asgard. ",MALE
225,SCRAPPER #142,"Many apologies, your majesty.",MALE
226,HELA,It’s come to my attention that you don’t know who I am.,FEMALE
227,HELA,"I am Hela, Odin’s first born, Commander of the legions of Asgard, the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death. My father is dead.  As are the princes.  You’re welcome. We were once the seat of absolute power in the Cosmos.  Our supremacy was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.  Our destiny is to rule over all others.  And I am here to restore that power.  Kneel before me...and rise into the ranks of my great conquest. ",FEMALE
228,HOGUN,"Whoever you are... whatever you’ve done, surrender now!  Or we will show you know mercy. ",MALE
229,HELA,Whoever I am?  Did you listen to a word I said?,FEMALE
230,HOGUN,This is your last warning!,MALE
231,HELA,I thought you’d be happy to see me.,FEMALE
232,HELA,Fine.,FEMALE
233,HELA,"Oh, I’ve missed this.  Still, it’s a shame.  Good soldiers dying for nothing...all because they couldn’t see the future.  Sad. Oh!  Look, still alive.",FEMALE
234,HELA,Change of heart?,FEMALE
235,HOGUN,Go back to whatever cave you crept out of you evil demoness!,MALE
236,HELA,Let’s go see my palace.,FEMALE
237,SOOTHING VOICE,"Fear not, for you are found.  You are home, and there is no going back.  No one leaves this place.",FEMALE
238,SOOTHING VOICE,But what is this place?  The answer in Sakaar.,FEMALE
239,SOOTHING VOICE,"Surrounded by cosmic gateways, Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown. ",FEMALE
240,SOOTHING VOICE,"It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.  Like you. But here on Sakaar, you are significant.  You are valuable. Here, you are loved. ",FEMALE
241,THOR,What...the hell?,MALE
242,SOOTHING VOICE,And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.,FEMALE
243,SOOTHING VOICE,"He is the original.  The first lost, and the first found.  The creator of Sakaar and the father of the Contest of Champions.",FEMALE
244,SOOTHING VOICE,"Where once you were nothing, now you are something.  You are the property of the Grandmaster. Congratulations!  You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.",FEMALE
245,SOOTHING VOICE,Prepare yourself.  Prepare yourself.  You are now meeting the Grandmaster.,FEMALE
246,GRANDMASTER,He’s wonderful. It is a he?,MALE
247,SCRAPPER #142,It’s a he.,MALE
248,GRANDMASTER,"Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? “She is the...” and it starts with a B. ",MALE
249,TOPAZ,Trash.,MALE
250,GRANDMASTER,"No, not trash.  Were you waiting just to call her that?  It doesn’t start with a “B.” ",MALE
251,TOPAZ,Booze hag.,MALE
252,GRANDMASTER,"I’m so sorry.  No, “best.”  I was thinking about “best.” Because I always say you’re the best.  She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know. ",MALE
253,TOPAZ,You say that every time she’s here.,MALE
254,GRANDMASTER,What have you brought today?  Tell me.,MALE
255,SCRAPPER #142,A contender.,MALE
256,THOR,A what?,MALE
257,GRANDMASTER,I need to go closer.  I want a closer look at this.  Can you take us closer?  Thank you.,MALE
258,GRANDMASTER,Pay this lady.,MALE
259,THOR,Just wait a damn minute.  I’m not for sale.,MALE
260,GRANDMASTER,Man.  He is a fighter.,MALE
261,SCRAPPER #142,I’d take 10 million.,MALE
262,TOPAZ,Tell her she’s dreaming.,MALE
263,GRANDMASTER,"For heaven’s sake, transfer the units.",MALE
264,THOR,You’ll pay for this!,MALE
265,SCRAPPER #142,"No, I got paid for this.",MALE
266,GRANDMASTER,Here’s what I wanna know.  Who are you?,MALE
267,THOR,I am the God of THUNDER!!!,MALE
268,GRANDMASTER,"Wow.  I didn’t hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles? ",MALE
269,TOPAZ,We located your cousin.,MALE
270,GRANDMASTER,"Oh good! Yeah, come on. I think you’re gonna like this.",MALE
271,GRANDMASTER,"There he is.  Hey, cuz.  We almost couldn’t find you.  What, have you been hiding?",MALE
272,THOR,Hi.,MALE
273,GRANDMASTER,So...,MALE
274,COUSIN CARLO,Please.  I’m sorry.,MALE
275,GRANDMASTER,Carlo... I pardon you.,MALE
276,COUSIN CARLO,Thank you.  Thank you.,MALE
277,GRANDMASTER,You’re officially pardoned...from life.,MALE
278,THOR,"Oh, my god!",MALE
279,GRANDMASTER,I’m stepping in it.  I’m stepping in it.  Look out!,MALE
280,THOR,"Oh, the smell. ",MALE
281,GRANDMASTER,What does it smell like?,MALE
282,TOPAZ,Burnt toast.,MALE
283,GRANDMASTER,What happened to my manners?  I haven’t properly introduced myself. Come on.  Follow me.,MALE
284,GRANDMASTER,"My name is Grandmaster.  I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.  People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.  And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.  What do you say to that? ",MALE
285,THOR,"We’re not friends, and I don’t give a shit about your games! I’m going back to Asgard! ",MALE
286,GRANDMASTER,"Ass-gard? One, two, three, four.",MALE
287,LOKI,"There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.  At that moment, I let go. ",MALE
288,THOR,Loki!? Loki! Over here!,MALE
289,LOKI,Excuse me one second.,MALE
290,THOR,Loki!,MALE
291,LOKI,What?  You’re alive?,MALE
292,THOR,"Yes, of course I’m alive. ",MALE
293,LOKI,What are you doing here?,MALE
294,THOR,"What do you mean, what am I doing? I’m stuck in this stupid chair. Where’s your chair? ",MALE
295,LOKI,I didn’t get a chair.,MALE
296,THOR,Get me out of this one.,MALE
297,LOKI,I can’t.,MALE
298,THOR,What?,MALE
299,LOKI,I’ve made friends with this man. He’s called the Grandmaster.,MALE
300,THOR,"Oh, he’s crazy! ",MALE
301,LOKI,I’ve gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.,MALE
302,THOR,Weeks ago?  I just got here.,MALE
303,GRANDMASTER,What are you whispering about?,MALE
304,GRANDMASTER,"Time works real different around these parts. On any other world, I’d be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar...",MALE
305,GRANDMASTER,"In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder? ",MALE
306,THOR,God of Thunder.  Tell him.,MALE
307,LOKI,I’ve never met this man in my life.,MALE
308,THOR,He’s my brother.,MALE
309,LOKI,Adopted.,MALE
310,GRANDMASTER,Is he any kind of a fighter?,MALE
311,THOR,You take this thing out of my neck and I’ll show you.,MALE
312,GRANDMASTER,"Now listen to that.  He’s threatening me.  Hey, Sparkles, here’s the deal.  If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg... ",MALE
313,THOR,Asgard.,MALE
314,GRANDMASTER,"Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win. ",MALE
315,THOR,Fine.  Then point me in the direction of whoever’s ass I have to kick.,MALE
316,GRANDMASTER,"That’s what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord. ",MALE
317,THOR,Loki!,MALE
318,KORG,"Hey!  Take it easy man! Over here.  The pile of rocks waving at you.  Yeah I’m actually a thing, I’m a being.  Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I’m kind of like the leader in here.  I’m made of rocks, as you can see, but don’t let that intimidate you.  You don’t need to be afraid unless you’re made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.  This is my very good friend over here, Miek.  He’s an insect and has knives for hands.",MALE
319,THOR,"You’re a Kronan, aren’t you? ",MALE
320,KORG,That I am.,MALE
321,THOR,How’d you end up in here?,MALE
322,KORG,"Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn’t print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. Except for my mom and her boyfriend, who I hate.  As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.  Bit of a promotional disaster. But I’m actually organizing another revolution.  I don’t know if you’d be interested in something like that.  Do you reckon you’d be interested?",MALE
323,THOR,How did you...,MALE
324,KORG,"Yeah, no.  This whole thing is a circle.  But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle. ",MALE
325,THOR,This doesn’t make any sense.,MALE
326,KORG,"No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense. ",MALE
327,THOR,Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster’s Champion?,MALE
328,KORG,"Doug has. Doug! Oh, right, Doug’s dead. That’s right.  Everyone who fights the Grandmaster’s champion perishes. ",MALE
329,THOR,What about you? You’re made of rocks.,MALE
330,KORG,"Perishable rocks. There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot.  Wait. You’re not gonna face him, are you? ",MALE
331,THOR,"Yes I am.  Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place. ",MALE
332,KORG,"That’s exactly what Doug used to say.  See you later, new Doug.",MALE
333,HELA,Does no one remember me?  Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies.  Goblets and garden parties?  Peace treaties?,FEMALE
334,HELA,Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it.,FEMALE
335,HELA,"We were unstoppable. I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard’s empire. One by one, the realms became ours.",FEMALE
336,HELA,"But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.  Before that, Asgard’s warriors were honored, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very place.",FEMALE

355,LOKI,"You’re not seriously thinking of going back, are you? Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.  She’s stronger than both of us.  She’s stronger than you. You don’t stand a chance. Do you understand what I’m saying to you?",MALE
356,LOKI,Fine.  I guess I’ll just have to go it alone.  Like I’ve always done.  Would you say something?,MALE
357,LOKI,Say something!,MALE
358,THOR,"What would you like me to say?  You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death. Have I said enough, or do you do you want me to go further back than the past two days?",MALE
359,LOKI,"You know, I haven’t seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I’ve heard he’s astonishingly savage.  I’ve placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don’t let me down.",MALE

361,KORG,"Yuck!  There’s Still someone’s hair and blood all over this.  Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?  Disgusting slobs. Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork? ",MALE
362,THOR,No.,MALE
363,KORG,"Yeah, not really useful unless you’re fighting off three vampires that were huddled together. ",MALE
364,THOR,I really wish I had my hammer.,MALE
365,KORG,Hammer?,MALE
366,THOR,"Quite unique.  It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.  And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly. ",MALE
367,KORG,You rode a hammer?,MALE
368,THOR,"No, I didn’t ride the hammer. ",MALE
369,KORG,The hammer rode you on your back?,MALE

371,KORG,Oh my God.  The hammer pulled you off?,MALE
372,THOR,"The ground.  It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly.  Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me. ",MALE
373,KORG,Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.,MALE
374,THOR,That’s a nice way of putting it.,MALE
375,SCRAPPER #142,I said they’re mine.,MALE
376,THOR,"See her, the one that put me in here. ",MALE

380,THOR,Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.  Asgard is in danger.,MALE
381,THOR,"My God, you’re a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women.  There’s nothing wrong with women, of course.  I love women.  Sometimes a little too much.  Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.  I think it’s great that there is an elite force of women warriors.  It’s about time. ",MALE
382,SCRAPPER #142,Are you done?,MALE

640,BRUCE BANNER,Yeah!  One!,MALE
641,THOR,Now you’ve been on two. That’s a good thing.  It’s a new experience.,MALE
642,BRUCE BANNER,"My neurons, they’re firing faster than my brain can handle the information. The whole thing is totally different this time. In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it’s like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk. ",MALE
643,THOR,"Alright, well, you’re back now, that’s all that matters. ",MALE
644,BRUCE BANNER,"No, it’s not what matters.  What I’m trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back.  And we’re stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out. ",MALE
645,THOR,"We’re not stranded, I’m gonna figure out a way to get us home. ",MALE
646,BRUCE BANNER,Thank you.,MALE
647,THOR,"Not your home, though.  Asgard. ",MALE
648,BRUCE BANNER,What?,MALE
649,THOR,"Listen, my people are in great danger.  You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister. ",MALE
650,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don’t wanna fight your sister.  That’s a family issue. ",MALE
651,THOR,"No, she’s an evil being. ",MALE
652,BRUCE BANNER,I don’t care what she is.  I’m not fighting any more beings.  I’m sick of it.  I just told you.,MALE
653,BRUCE BANNER,"If I turn into the BRUCE BANNER, I am never gonna come back again. And you don’t care. ",MALE
654,THOR,"No, no.  I’m putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire. ",MALE
655,BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, you’re just using me to get to the Hulk. ",MALE
656,THOR,What?  No!,MALE
657,BRUCE BANNER,It’s gross.  You don’t care about me.  You’re not my friend.,MALE
658,THOR,"No!  I don’t even like the Hulk. He’s all like... “smash, smash, smash.”  I prefer you. ",MALE
659,BRUCE BANNER,Thanks.,MALE
660,THOR,"But if I’m being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful. ",MALE
661,BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, Banner’s powerful and useful, too. ",MALE
662,THOR,Is he though?,MALE
663,BRUCE BANNER,How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.  How many PhDs does Banner have?  Seven.,MALE
664,THOR,"Fine, you don’t have to fight anyone.  But we’re in danger here, so we have to move.",MALE
665,BRUCE BANNER,What are you doing with that?,MALE
666,THOR,I need a disguise.  I’m a fugitive.,MALE
667,BRUCE BANNER,I need a disguise.,MALE
668,THOR,You are the disguise.,MALE
669,BRUCE BANNER,I’ll be Tony Stark.,MALE
670,THOR,What?,MALE
671,BRUCE BANNER,Yeah.  Tony and the gypsy.,MALE
672,THOR,"No, no you’re not Tony.  You’re Bruce Banner. ",MALE
673,BRUCE BANNER,Then why did you dress me up like Tony?,MALE
674,THOR,Because you were naked.,MALE
675,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, I’ll give you that.",MALE
676,THOR,What are you doing?  Stop doing that!,MALE
677,BRUCE BANNER,Tony wears his pants super tight!,MALE
678,THOR,Why are you being so weird?,MALE
679,BRUCE BANNER,I don’t know. Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird.,MALE
680,THOR,"Hey.  It’s okay.  You’re good. Calm down.  Come on.  Listen, we’re gonna go to Asgard and you’re not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right? ",MALE
681,BRUCE BANNER,All right.,MALE
682,THOR,This is bad.  Banner!  Banner!,MALE
683,THOR,Hi.,MALE
684,VALKYRIE,Hi.,FEMALE
685,THOR,I was gonna do that.,MALE
686,VALKYRIE,"Yeah, well, I did it first. ",FEMALE
687,THOR,That’s good.  What are you doing here?,MALE
688,VALKYRIE,What are you doing here?  I thought you were leaving.,FEMALE
689,THOR,I got sidetracked.,MALE
690,VALKYRIE,What’s with the...,FEMALE
691,THOR,It’s my disguise.,MALE
692,VALKYRIE,But I can see your face.,FEMALE
693,THOR,"Not when I do this, you can’t. Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?",MALE
694,BRUCE BANNER,What are those things on her eyes? Are those the people that she’s killed? She’s so beautiful and strong...,MALE
695,VALKYRIE,Who is this guy?,FEMALE
696,THOR,He’s a friend.,MALE
697,BRUCE BANNER,Who?  Me?  I’m Bruce.,MALE
698,VALKYRIE,I feel like I know you.,FEMALE
699,BRUCE BANNER,I feel like I know you too.,MALE
700,VALKYRIE,"Look, I’ve spent years in a haze trying to forget my past.  Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day. ",FEMALE
701,THOR,"I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you. ",MALE
702,VALKYRIE,"I don’t plan to stop drinking, but I don’t want to forget.  I can’t turn away anymore.  So, if I’m donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag. ",FEMALE
703,THOR,Good.,MALE
704,VALKYRIE,Yeah.  So I’m saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?,FEMALE
705,THOR,"Yeah, it’s called the Revengers. ",MALE
706,VALKYRIE,Revengers?,FEMALE
707,THOR,Because I’m getting revenge. You’re getting revenge. Do you want revenge?,MALE
708,BRUCE BANNER,I’m undecided.,MALE
709,THOR,Okay.,MALE
710,VALKYRIE,"Also, I’ve got a peace offering.",FEMALE
711,LOKI,Surprise.,MALE
712,LOKI,OW!,MALE
713,THOR,Just had to be sure.,MALE
714,LOKI,"Hello, Bruce. ",MALE
715,BRUCE BANNER,"So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.  Where are you at these days? ",MALE
716,LOKI,It varies from moment to moment.,MALE
717,THOR,Is that... a Dragonfang?,MALE
718,VALKYRIE,It is.,FEMALE
719,THOR,My God.  This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.,MALE
720,VALKYRIE,Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits. A nice clean wormhole outside the city.,FEMALE
721,VALKYRIE,Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months.,FEMALE
722,THOR,Nope. We’re going through that one.,MALE
723,VALKYRIE,The Devil’s Anus?,FEMALE
724,BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, whose anus are we going through? ",MALE
725,THOR,"For the record, I didn’t know it was called that when I picked it. ",MALE
726,BRUCE BANNER,That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge.,MALE
727,VALKYRIE,We need another ship.  That would tear mine to pieces.,FEMALE
728,THOR,She’s right.  We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.,MALE
729,BRUCE BANNER,And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer.,MALE
730,VALKYRIE,"And we need one with cup holders, because we’re gonna die.  So, drinks! ",FEMALE
731,BRUCE BANNER,Do I know you?  I feel like I know you.,MALE
732,VALKYRIE,"I feel like I know you, too. It’s weird. ",FEMALE
733,THOR,"What do you say, doctor?  Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.",MALE
734,BRUCE BANNER,We need a ship.,MALE
735,THOR,Need a ship.,MALE
736,VALKYRIE,"There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models-- ",FEMALE
737,LOKI,"I don’t mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.",MALE
738,VALKYRIE,And suddenly you’re overcome with an urge to do the right thing.,FEMALE
739,LOKI,"Heavens, no. I’ve run out of favor with the Grandmaster. And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I’m asking for safe passage...through the anus. ",MALE
740,THOR,You’re telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?,MALE
741,LOKI,"Yes, brother. I can. ",MALE
742,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us. ",MALE
743,VALKYRIE,He did try to kill me.,FEMALE
744,THOR,"Yes, me too.  On many, many occasions.  There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes.  So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, “Yeah, it’s me!” And he stabbed me.  We were eight at the time.",MALE
745,VALKYRIE,"If we’re boosting a ship, we’re gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace. ",FEMALE
746,LOKI,Why not set the beast loose?,MALE
747,THOR,Shut up.,MALE
748,VALKYRIE,You guys have a beast?,FEMALE
749,THOR,"No, there’s no beast. He’s just being stupid.  We’re going to start a revolution. ",MALE
750,BRUCE BANNER,Revolution?,MALE
751,THOR,I’ll explain later.,MALE
752,VALKYRIE,Who’s this guy again?,FEMALE
753,THOR,I’ll explain later.,MALE
754,KORG,"Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that’s coming out of you?  Or are they eggs?  Looks like eggs.",MALE
755,VALKYRIE,I’m looking for Korg.,FEMALE
756,KORG,"Who’s asking?  I know you’re asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?",MALE
757,VALKYRIE,The Lord of Thunder sends his best.,FEMALE
758,KORG,My revolution has begun...,MALE
759,GRANDMASTER,Revolution?  How did this happen?,MALE
760,TOPAZ,Don’t know.  But the Arena’s mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.,MALE
761,GRANDMASTER,Oh! I don’t like that word!,MALE
762,TOPAZ,Mainframe?,MALE
763,GRANDMASTER,"No.  Why would I not like “mainframe?”  No, the “S” word. ",MALE
764,TOPAZ,"Sorry, the “prisoners with jobs” have armed themselves. ",MALE
765,GRANDMASTER,"Okay, that’s better.",MALE
766,THOR,"Hey, so listen, we should talk. ",MALE
767,LOKI,I disagree.  Open communication was never our family’s forte.,MALE
768,THOR,You have no idea.  I’ve had quite the revelation since we spoke last.,MALE
769,THOR,Hello!,MALE
770,LOKI,Hi!,MALE
771,LOKI,"Odin brought us together, it’s almost poetic that his death should split us apart.  We might as well be strangers now.  “Two sons of the crown” set adrift.",MALE
772,THOR,Thought you didn’t want to talk about it?,MALE
773,LOKI,Here’s the thing. I’m probably better off staying here on Sakaar.,MALE
774,THOR,That’s exactly what I was thinking.,MALE
775,LOKI,...Did you just agree with me?,MALE
776,THOR,"This place is perfect for you. It’s savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you’re going to do GREAT here. ",MALE
777,LOKI,Do you truly think so little of me?,MALE
778,THOR,"Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of the day, you’re you, I’m me... I don’t know, maybe there’s still good in you, but let’s be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.",MALE
779,LOKI,It’s probably for the best that we never see one another again.,MALE
780,THOR,That’s what you always wanted.,MALE
781,THOR,"Hey, let’s do “Get Help.” ",MALE
782,LOKI,What?,MALE
783,THOR,“Get Help.”,MALE
784,LOKI,No.,MALE
785,THOR,"Come on, you love it. ",MALE
786,LOKI,I hate it.,MALE
787,THOR,It’s great. IT works every time.,MALE
788,LOKI,It’s humiliating.,MALE
789,THOR,Do you have a better plan?,MALE
790,LOKI,No.,MALE
791,THOR,We’re doing it.,MALE
792,LOKI,We are not doing “Get Help.”,MALE
793,THOR,"Get help! Please! My brother, he’s dying.",MALE
794,THOR,Get help! Help him!,MALE
795,THOR,Classic.,MALE
796,LOKI,I still hate it. It’s humiliating.,MALE
797,THOR,"Not for me, it’s not. ",MALE
798,THOR,Which one’s the ship she told us to get?,MALE
799,LOKI,The Commodore.,MALE
800,LOKI,Though I feel it won’t make much of a difference...,MALE
801,THOR,"Oh, Loki.",MALE
802,LOKI,"I know I’ve betrayed you many times before, but this time it’s truly nothing personal.  The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.",MALE
803,THOR,"Never one for sentiment, were you? ",MALE
804,LOKI,Easier to let it burn.,MALE
805,THOR,I agree.,MALE
806,THOR,"Oh brother, you’re becoming predictable.  I trust you, you betray me.  Round and round in circles we go.",MALE
807,THOR,"See, Loki, life is about, it’s about growth.  It’s about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I’m trying to say is that you’ll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more.  I’ll just put this over here for you.",MALE
808,THOR,"Anyway, I got places to be so good luck.",MALE
809,THOR,"All right, I can figure this out. It’s just another spaceship.",MALE
810,GRANDMASTER,"Loyal Sakaarians, Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.  Sakaarians, take to the skies.  Bring him down.  Do not let him leave this planet.",MALE
811,BRUCE BANNER,Good shot!,MALE
812,VALKYRIE,Open the doors.,FEMALE
813,VALKYRIE,I hope that you’re tougher than you look.,FEMALE
814,BRUCE BANNER,Why?,MALE
815,BRUCE BANNER,Shouldn’t we be shooting back or something?,MALE
816,THOR,"Yes, we should. Where are the guns on this ship? ",MALE
817,VALKYRIE,There aren’t any.  It’s a leisure vessel.,FEMALE
818,THOR / BRUCE BANNER,WHAT?!,MALE
819,VALKYRIE,"Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.",FEMALE
820,BRUCE BANNER,Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?,MALE
821,THOR,Yeah. Don’t touch anything.,MALE
822,THOR,No!,MALE
823,THOR,Get inside!,MALE
824,VALKYRIE,In a minute!,FEMALE
825,THOR,I should probably go and help.,MALE
826,THOR,"Here, take the wheel. ",MALE
827,BRUCE BANNER,No. I don’t know how to fly one of these.,MALE
828,THOR,You’re a scientist.  Use one of your PhDs.,MALE
829,BRUCE BANNER,None of them are for flying alien spaceships!,MALE
830,BRUCE BANNER,"Okay, come on.  There’s gotta be a gun on this thing.  That looks like a gun.",MALE
831,GRANDMASTER,It’s MY BIRTHDAY! It’s MY BIRTHDAY! It’s MY BIRTHDAY.,MALE
832,BRUCE BANNER,Yeah!,MALE
833,VALKYRIE,"Guys, we’re coming up on the Devil’s Anus!",FEMALE
834,KORG,"There she is.  Our ticket out of here.  Hey, what’s this?",MALE
835,LOKI,Thank you.,MALE
836,KORG,"Hey man, we’re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.  You wanna come? ",MALE
837,LOKI,You do seem like you’re in desperate need of leadership.,MALE
838,KORG,Why thank you.,MALE
839,VALKYRIE,Here we go!,FEMALE
840,SKURGE,"Asgardians, some misguided soul has stolen the Bifrost sword.  Tell us where it is, or there will be consequences.  Bad ones.",MALE
841,SKURGE,Well?,MALE
842,HELA,You.,FEMALE
843,ASGARDIAN CITIZENS,No! Stop!,NEUTRAL
844,HELA,Well?  Executioner?,FEMALE
845,ASGARDIAN MAN,Wait! I know where the sword is.,MALE
846,VALKYRIE,I never thought I’d be back here.,FEMALE
847,BRUCE BANNER,"I thought it’d be nicer.  I mean, not that it’s not nice.  It’s just, it’s on fire. ",MALE
848,VALKYRIE,"Here, up here in the mountains.",FEMALE
849,VALKYRIE,Heat signatures.  People clustered together.  Hela’s coming for them.,FEMALE
850,THOR,"Okay, drop me off at the palace and I’ll draw her away. ",MALE
851,VALKYRIE,And get yourself killed?,FEMALE
852,THOR,"The people trapped down there are all that matters.  While I’m dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard. ",MALE
853,BRUCE BANNER,How the hell are we supposed to do that?,MALE
854,THOR,I have a man on the ground.,MALE
855,HEIMDALL,Asgard. She’s here.,MALE
856,THOR,Now the ship has guns.,MALE
857,VALKYRIE,I’ll take it from here.,FEMALE
858,THOR,I found this in the armory.,MALE
859,VALKYRIE,“Your majesty.”  Don’t die.  You know what I mean.,FEMALE
860,HEIMDALL,We must keep moving! Go to the Bifrost!,MALE
861,THOR,Sister.,MALE
862,HELA,You’re still alive.,FEMALE
863,THOR,"I love what you’ve done with the place.  Redecorating, I see. ",MALE
864,HELA,It seems our father’s solution to every problem was to cover it up.,FEMALE
865,THOR,Or to cast it out. He told you you were worthy.  He said the same thing to me.,MALE
866,HELA,"You see, you never knew him, not at his best. Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears. Where do you think all this gold came from? And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king. To foster peace, to protect life. To have you. ",FEMALE
867,THOR,"I understand why you’re angry. And you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne. And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule. But it can’t be you.  You’re just...the worst.",MALE
868,HELA,"Okay, get up.  You’re in my seat. ",FEMALE
869,THOR,"You know, Father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war. ",MALE
870,HELA,But must always be ready for it.,FEMALE
871,HEIMDALL,Go back!,MALE
872,HELA,"To be honest, I expected more.",FEMALE
873,SKURGE,Heimdall!  The sword!,MALE
874,HEIMDALL,We must cross now!  To Bi-Frost!,MALE
875,HELA,"Here’s the difference between us. I’m Odin’s firstborn, the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard. And you’re nothing. ",FEMALE
876,HELA,So simple.  Even a blind man could see it.,FEMALE
877,HELA,Now you remind me of Dad.,FEMALE
878,VALKYRIE,This stupid dog won’t die!,FEMALE
879,BRUCE BANNER,Everything’s going to be okay.  I got this.  You want to know who I am?,MALE
880,VALKYRIE,What the hell are you talking about?,FEMALE
881,BRUCE BANNER,You’ll see.,MALE
882,HELA,You see?  No one’s going anywhere. I’ll get that sword even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.,FEMALE
883,KORG,Hey man.  I’m Korg.  This is Miek.,MALE
884,KORG,We’re going to jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Want to come?,MALE
885,LOKI,Your savior is here!,MALE
886,HELA,That little shit.,FEMALE
887,LOKI,"Did you miss me?  Everybody on that ship, now.",MALE
888,HEIMDALL,Welcome home.  I saw you coming.,MALE
889,LOKI,Of course you did.,MALE
890,HELA,"A valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.",FEMALE
891,HELA,"You see?  I’m not a queen, or a monster. ",FEMALE
892,HELA,I’m the Goddess of Death.,FEMALE
893,HELA,What were you the God of again?,FEMALE
894,ODIN,Even when you had two eyes you were only seeing half the picture.,MALE
895,THOR,She’s too strong.  Without my hammer I cannot--,MALE
896,ODIN,"Are you Thor, God of Hammers?",MALE
897,ODIN,"That hammer helped you control your power, focus it.  But it was never the source of your strength.",MALE
898,THOR,It’s too late. She’s already taken Asgard.,MALE
899,ODIN,Asgard is not a place. Never has been. This could be Asgard.  It is wherever our people stand.  And right now those people need you.,MALE
900,THOR,I’m not as strong as you.,MALE
901,ODIN,No.  You’re stronger. ,MALE
902,HELA,"Tell me brother, what were you the God of again...? ",FEMALE
903,THOR,You’re late.,MALE
904,LOKI,You’re missing an eye.,MALE
905,VALKYRIE,This isn’t over.,FEMALE
906,THOR,I think we should disband the Revengers.,MALE
907,LOKI,Hit her with a lightning blast.,MALE
908,THOR,I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.  It did nothing.,MALE
909,VALKYRIE,We need to hold her off until everybody’s on board.,FEMALE
910,THOR,It won’t end there.  The longer Hela’s on Asgard the more powerful she grows.  She’ll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.,MALE
911,VALKYRIE,What’s our move?,FEMALE
912,LOKI,I’m not doing “Get help.”,MALE
913,THOR,"Asgard’s not a place, it’s a people. This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. Go to the vault.  Surtur’s crown. It’s the only way. ",MALE
914,LOKI,"Bold move, brother. Even for me.",MALE
915,THOR,Shall we?,MALE
916,VALKYRIE,After you.,FEMALE
917,LOKI,This is madness.,MALE
918,THOR,GO!  GO NOW!,MALE
919,SKURGE,For Asgard.,MALE
920,SKURGE,HELA!,MALE
921,LOKI,"With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.",MALE
922,THOR,HELA!  Enough!,MALE
923,THOR,You want Asgard?  It’s yours.,MALE
924,HELA,"Whatever game you’re playing, it won’t work.  You can’t defeat me. ",FEMALE
925,THOR,"No, but he can.",MALE
926,HELA,No...NO!,FEMALE
927,SURTUR,"Tremble before me Asgard, for I am your reckoning!",MALE
928,VALKYRIE,The people are safe.  That’s all that matters.,FEMALE
929,THOR,We’re fulfilling the prophecy.,MALE
930,VALKYRIE,I hate this prophecy.,FEMALE
931,THOR,"So do I, but we have no choice.",MALE
932,THOR,"Surtur destroys Asgard, he destroys Hela so that our people can live.",MALE
933,THOR,We need to let him finish... No!,MALE
934,THOR,Hulk no!  Stop it you moron!!,MALE
935,THOR,"BRUCE BANNER, just for once in your life, don’t smash! ",MALE
936,BRUCE BANNER,But...big Monster.,MALE
937,VALKYRIE,Hulk! Let’s go.,FEMALE
938,BRUCE BANNER,Friends.,MALE
939,SURTUR,I am Asgard’s doom!!,MALE
940,KORG,"The damage is not too bad.  As long as the foundations are strong, we can rebuild this place.  It will become a haven for all people and aliens of the universe...",MALE
941,KORG,"Nope, those foundations are gone. Sorry.",MALE
942,THOR,What have I done?,MALE
943,HEIMDALL,"You saved us from extinction. Asgard is not a place, it’s a people.",MALE
944,LOKI,It suits you.,MALE
945,THOR,"Perhaps you’re not so bad after all, brother. ",MALE
946,LOKI,Maybe not.,MALE
947,THOR,"Thank you, Loki.",MALE
948,THOR,"And if you were here, I might even give you a hug.",MALE
949,LOKI,Do we have to hug now?,MALE
950,VALKYRIE,Your throne.,FEMALE
951,HEIMDALL,"So, King of Asgard.",MALE
952,HEIMDALL,Where to?,MALE
953,THOR,"I’m not sure.  Any suggestions? Miek, what’s your home planet?",MALE
954,KORG,"Oh, Miek’s dead.  I accidentally stepped on him on the bridge, I’ve just felt so guilty I’ve been carrying him around all day...",MALE
955,KORG,"Miek, you’re alive!  He’s alive everyone!  What was your question?",MALE
956,THOR,Earth it is.,MALE
957,LOKI,Do you really think it’s a good idea to go back to Earth?,MALE
958,THOR,Sure!  They love me there.,MALE
959,LOKI,Let me rephrase: Do you really think it’s a good idea to bring me back to Earth?,MALE
960,THOR,"Probably not.  But don’t worry, brother...I’ve got a feeling that everything’s going to work out.",MALE
