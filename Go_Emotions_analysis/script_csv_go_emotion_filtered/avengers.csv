BRUCE BANNER,He really grows on you doesn’t he?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"An army, from outer space? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Selvig?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,He’s an astrophysicist.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,He’s a friend.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,He killed eighty people in two days.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,He’s adopted?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MARIA HILL,He turns!,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
MARIA HILL,When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Finally. Someone who speaks English.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Is that what just happened?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,...Thanks.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NICK FURY,Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NICK FURY,"I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Monkeys? I do not understand-,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I do!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I...I understood that reference.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Shall we play, Doctor? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"This way, sir.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,All I packed was a toothbrush.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises. He zaps Banner in the side. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,Ow!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Hey!,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Nothing?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Are you nuts?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Is everything a joke to you?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Funny things are.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,You think Fury’s hiding something?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and- ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Doctor?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"A warm light for all mankind,"" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I heard it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, I think that was meant for you.  Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,The Stark Tower? That big ugly building in New York?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,I’m sorry did you say-,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Following’s not really my style.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,"And you’re all about style, aren’t you? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Out of the people in this room, which one is ""A"" wearing a spangly outfit and ""B"" not of use? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Just find the Cube.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,I’ll read all about it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,"Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- He taps the arc reactor. -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,But you can control it.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,Because I learned how.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,It’s different. ,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,"Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
TONY STARK,I guess we’ll find out.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
BRUCE BANNER,You may not enjoy that.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

PHIL COULSON,As soon as Loki took the doctor we...,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

THOR,Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PHIL COULSON,He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PHIL COULSON,Like what?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
PHIL COULSON,No.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.  When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NICK FURY,War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,"I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NICK FURY,"A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,What are you asking me to do?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NICK FURY,"I’m asking, what are you prepared to do? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
THOR,Loki is a prisoner.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

NATASHA ROMANOFF,But you figured I’d come.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate. ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,I’d say I’ve expanded his mind.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"Is this love, Agent Romanoff? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Love is for children. I owe him a debt.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,Tell me.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call. ",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,And what will you do if I vow to spare him?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not let you out.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man? ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

LOKI,And what are you now?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,...You lie and kill in the service of liars...,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"...and killers. You pretend to be separate, to have your own code...",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"...something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.  And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim! ",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You’re a monster!,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
LOKI,"Oh, no. You brought the monster.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So, Banner? That’s your play. ",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

NATASHA ROMANOFF,You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
