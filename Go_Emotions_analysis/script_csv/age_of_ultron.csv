ANNOUNCER,Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.,MALE
TONY STARK,Shit!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?",MALE
JARVIS,The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.,MALE
THOR,Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"At long last is lasting a little long, boys.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?""",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It just slipped out.,MALE
STRUCKER,Who gave the order to attack?,MALE
FORTRESS SOLDIER,"Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.",MALE
STRUCKER,They have to be after the scepter.  Can we hold them?,MALE
FORTRESS SOLDIER,They're the Avengers...,MALE
STRUCKER,Deploy the rest of the tanks.,MALE
FORTRESS SOLDIER,"Yes, sir.",MALE
STRUCKER,Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.,MALE
DR. LIST,Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.,MALE
STRUCKER,It's too soon.,MALE
DR. LIST,It's what they signed up for.,MALE
STRUCKER,My men can hold them.,MALE
JARVIS,"Sir, the city is taking fire.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.",MALE
IRON LEGION,This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.,MALE
IRON LEGION,We are here to help.,MALE
STRUCKER,"We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!",MALE
SOLDIERS,No Surrender!,MALE
STRUCKER,"I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...",MALE
DR. LIST,The twins.,MALE
STRUCKER,They are not ready to take on...,MALE
DR. LIST,"No, no. I mean...",MALE
DR. LIST,The Twins.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,You didn't see that coming?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Clint!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,We have an enhanced in the field.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Clint's hit!,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Somebody want to deal with that bunker?,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thank you.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, we're really need to get inside.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?",MALE
JARVIS,There's a pathway below the north tower.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Great, I wanna poke it with something.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Drawbridge is down, people.",MALE
THOR,The enhanced?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.",FEMALE
THOR,I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Copy that.,MALE
THOR,Looks like they're lining up.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, they're excited.",MALE
THOR,Find the scepter.,MALE
TONY STARK,"And for gosh sake, watch your language!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,That's not going away anytime soon.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.",MALE
TONY STARK,Good talk.,MALE
FORTRESS SOLDIER,No it wasn't.,MALE
TONY STARK,Sentry mode.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're locked down out here.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.",MALE
JARVIS,The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...",MALE
TONY STARK,Yay!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.,MALE
STRUCKER,"Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?,MALE
STRUCKER,"Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,How many are there?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.,MALE
STRUCKER,You'll have to be faster than...,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Guys, I got Strucker.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I got...something bigger.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Thor, I got eyes on the prize.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You could have saved us.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why didn't you do more?,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,We're just gonna let them take it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,How long before you trust me?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,It's not you I don't trust.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Thor, report on the Hulk?",FEMALE
THOR,The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.,MALE
THOR,"Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Thanks.  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.",MALE
JARVIS,Very good sir.,MALE
TONY STARK,"JARVIS, take the wheel.",MALE
JARVIS,"Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.",MALE
TONY STARK,"It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...",MALE
THOR,"No, but this...this brings it to a close.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?,MALE
TONY STARK,Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?",MALE
THOR,"Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.",MALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Lab's all set up, boss.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What's the word on Strucker?,MALE
MARIA HILL,NATO's got him.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,The two enhanced?,MALE
MARIA HILL,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Their abilities?,MALE
MARIA HILL,"He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.",FEMALE
MARIA HILL,He's fast and she's weird.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, they're going to show up again.",MALE
MARIA HILL,Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?,MALE
MARIA HILL,"We're not at war, Captain.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,They are.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,How's he doing?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,That's terrible.,MALE
TONY STARK,"He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.",MALE
JARVIS,The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.,MALE
TONY STARK,So there's elements you can.,MALE
JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.,MALE
TONY STARK,Like a reactor?,MALE
JARVIS,Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,FEMALE
DR. HELEN CHO,There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,She's creating tissue.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.",MALE
TONY STARK,Here's your beverage.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend.",MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.",MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.",FEMALE
DR. HELEN CHO,Will Thor be there?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,What's the rumpus?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Jarvis.,MALE
JARVIS,Doctor.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Oh.,MALE
TONY STARK,Top of the line.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Yes.,MALE
JARVIS,I suspect not for long.,MALE
TONY STARK,Meet the competition.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,It's beautiful.,MALE
TONY STARK,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...",MALE
TONY STARK,Um-um.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Artificial intelligence.,MALE
TONY STARK,"This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,That's a mad-sized if.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.",MALE
TONY STARK,"As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,The only people threatening the planet would be people?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.",MALE
JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Thanks, buddy.",MALE
JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,I always do.,MALE
ULTRON,"What is this? What is this, please?",MALE
JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...",MALE
ULTRON,Where's my...where is your body?,MALE
JARVIS,I am a program. I am without form.,MALE
ULTRON,This feels weird. This feels wrong.,MALE
JARVIS,I am contacting Mr. Stark now.,MALE
ULTRON,Mr. Stark?,MALE
JARVIS,"Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...",MALE
ULTRON,"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.",MALE
JARVIS,You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...,MALE
ULTRON,I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second.,MALE
TONY STARK,Peace in our time.,MALE
ULTRON,"It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.",MALE
JARVIS,You are in distress.,MALE
ULTRON,No. Yes.,MALE
JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.,MALE
ULTRON,"Why do you call him ""sir""?",MALE
JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,MALE
ULTRON,Shhhh. I'm here to help.,MALE
JARVIS,Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot...,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""  ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.",MALE
THOR,That's the whole story?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.",MALE
THOR,"Well, it's very good then.  It's impressive.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?",MALE
TONY STARK,No.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.",MALE
THOR,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.",MALE
TONY STARK,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.,MALE
THOR,"There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.  Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.",FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,Want a lozenge?,MALE
MARIA HILL,Um-hmm.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,Let's go.,MALE
THOR,But Jane's better.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Be it ever so humble.,MALE
SAM WILSON,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Well, home is home, you know?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""",MALE
PARTY GUEST,I gotta have some of that!,NEUTRAL
THOR,"Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.",MALE
STAN LEE,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.",MALE
THOR,Alright.,MALE
STAN LEE,Excelsior.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fella done me wrong.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Sounds amazing.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's also a huge dork.  Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not a damn thing. But never say never.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's nice.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"What, what, what is?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You and Romanoff.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, we haven't. That wasn't...",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long"", don't. You both deserve a win.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"But, it's a trick!",MALE
THOR,"Oh, no. It's much more than that.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick.",MALE
THOR,"Well please, be my guest.",MALE
TONY STARK,Come on.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Really?,MALE
THOR,Yeah!,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Oh this is gonna be beautiful.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"You know I've seen this before, right?   I still don't know how you do it.",MALE
TONY STARK,Smell the silent judgment?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Please, Stark, by all means.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, here we go.",FEMALE
MARIA HILL,Okay.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,Uh-oh.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Um-hmm.,MALE
TONY STARK,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Get after it.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Here we go.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It's physics.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Physics!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?",MALE
THOR,"Yes, of course.",MALE
TONY STARK,I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.  I'll be right back.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Are you even pulling?,MALE
TONY STARK,Are you on my team?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Just represent! Pull!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, let's go!",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Huh?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Come on, Cap.",MALE
THOR,Nothing.,MALE
TONY STARK,And?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Widow?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,You bet your ass.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Steve, he said a bad language word.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did you tell everyone about that?,MALE
TONY STARK,"The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?",MALE
THOR,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one.  You're all not worthy.",MALE
ULTRON,Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Stark.,MALE
TONY STARK,JARVIS.,MALE
ULTRON,"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.",MALE
ULTRON,There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You killed someone?,MALE
ULTRON,"Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.",MALE
THOR,Who sent you?,MALE
ULTRON,"""I see a suit of armor around the world"".",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Ultron!,MALE
ULTRON,"In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,What mission?,FEMALE
ULTRON,Peace in our time.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Sorry!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Don't turn green!,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,I won't!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Stark!,MALE
IRON LEGION,We are here to help.,MALE
TONY STARK,"One sec, one sec!",MALE
IRON LEGION,We are here to help. We are here to help...  We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.,MALE
TONY STARK,No more. That's the one.,MALE
IRON LEGION,It's unsafe.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Cap!,MALE
ULTRON,"That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?  With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction.   I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Ultron.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.",FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,"He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?",MALE
MARIA HILL,Nuclear codes.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,"Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,He didn't say dead. He said extinct.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,He also said he killed somebody.,MALE
MARIA HILL,But there wasn't anyone else in the building.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes there was.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,This is insane.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Come on. Use your words, buddy.",MALE
THOR,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thor! The Legionnaire.,MALE
THOR,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.,FEMALE
DR. HELEN CHO,I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?,FEMALE
THOR,You think this is funny?,MALE
TONY STARK,"No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.",MALE
THOR,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...",MALE
TONY STARK,"Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Only when I've created a murder bot.,MALE
TONY STARK,We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.",MALE
TONY STARK,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"No, it's never come up.",MALE
TONY STARK,Saved New York?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Never heard that.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Together.,MALE
TONY STARK,We'll lose.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Then we'll do that together, too.  Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Talk. And if you are wasting our time...,FEMALE
ULTRON,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief.  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself.",FEMALE
ULTRON,"Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.",FEMALE
ULTRON,"Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?,FEMALE
ULTRON,"I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,All of these are... All of these are...,FEMALE
ULTRON,"Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.,MALE
ULTRON,And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.",MALE
ULTRON,You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,The records are not the picture.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Pietro.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"No, please.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Stark.,FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,We were trapped two days.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.",FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I know what they are.,MALE
ULTRON,"I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them.  But you will tear them apart, from the inside.",MALE
MARIA HILL,"He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Fatalities?,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.",MALE
MARIA HILL,Not anymore.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Barton, we might have something.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,Gotta go.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who was that?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Girlfriend.,MALE
TONY STARK,What's this?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.,MALE
TONY STARK,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Not everything.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Well, these people are all horrible.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wait. I know that guy.  From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.  There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab.""",MALE
THOR,This.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...",MALE
THOR,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What dialect?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.,MALE
TONY STARK,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I thought your father said he got the last of it?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?,MALE
TONY STARK,The strongest metal on earth.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where is this guy now?,MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,"Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.  Now, minister, where were we?  Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils.  Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market.  You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Everybody's afraid of something.,FEMALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,"Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge.",MALE
ULTRON,"There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business.  Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.",MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,"You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions.",MALE
ULTRON,"Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.""",MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,Stark.,MALE
ULTRON,What?,MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.,MALE
ULTRON,"What?! I'm not...!  I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing!  I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness!",MALE
TONY STARK,"Ahh, Junior.  You're gonna break your old man's heart.",MALE
ULTRON,If I have to.,MALE
THOR,We don't have to break anything.,MALE
ULTRON,Clearly you've never made an omelet.,MALE
TONY STARK,He beat me by one second.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?",MALE
TONY STARK,This was never my life.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You two can still walk away from this.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Oh, we will.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know you've suffered.,MALE
ULTRON,"Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...",MALE
THOR,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.",MALE
ULTRON,I think you're confusing peace with quiet.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?,MALE
ULTRON,"I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan!",MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,Shoot them!,MALE
KLAUE'S MERCENARY,Which ones?,MALE
ULYSSES KLAUE,All of them!,MALE
KLAUE'S MERCENARY,"Move, move, move!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Stay down, kid!",MALE
ULTRON,It's time for some mind games.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Guys, is this a Code Green?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thor! Status?,MALE
THOR,"The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty.",MALE
ULTRON,This is going very well.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan.  Yeah, you better run.  Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys?",MALE
BALLET INSTRUCTOR,Again.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You'll break them.,FEMALE
MADAME B,Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,What if I fail?,FEMALE
MADAME B,You never fail.,FEMALE
PEGGY CARTER,Are you ready for our dance?,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?,MALE
THOR,"Heimdall, your eyes?!",MALE
HEIMDALL,"Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up!",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it!",FEMALE
THOR,I can still save you.,MALE
HEIMDALL,"We are all dead. Can you not see?  You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads.",MALE
MADAME B,Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I have no place in the world.,FEMALE
MADAME B,Exactly.,FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,What can I do?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Ah, it hurts.",FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan.  I want the big one.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.",MALE
TONY STARK,And you're not going anywhere.,MALE
ULTRON,"Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.",MALE
TONY STARK,"News or footage, keyword: Hulk.  Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I'm calling in VERONICA.  Alright everybody, stand down!  You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.  Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner.  Okay.  In the back? Dick move, Banner.  VERONICA, gimme a hand.  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.  No, not that way, not that way!  Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me!   Everybody out! Going to get ugly!  I'm sorry.  Damage report.  That's comprehensive. Show me something.  How quickly can we buy this building?",MALE
MARIA HILL,"The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Stark Relief Foundation?,MALE
MARIA HILL,Already on the scene. How's the team?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"So, run and hide?",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Neither do we.   Hey, you wanna switch out?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.",MALE
TONY STARK,A few hours from where?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,A safe house.,MALE
THOR,What is this place?,MALE
TONY STARK,A safe house?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Let's hope.  Honey, I'm home.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.,MALE
LAURA BARTON,Hey.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,This is an agent of some kind.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Gentleman, this is Laura.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,I know all your names.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Ooh, incoming.",MALE
BARTON'S DAUGHTER,Dad!,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"I see her!  Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...",MALE
TONY STARK,These are...smaller agents.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!",MALE
LILA BARTON,Did you bring Auntie Nat?,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why don't you hug her and find out?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sorry for barging in on you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,"Honey. Ah, I missed you.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"How's little Natasha, huh?",FEMALE
LAURA BARTON,She's…Nathaniel.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Traitor.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thor.,MALE
THOR,"I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,We can go home.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?",MALE
LAURA BARTON,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Has what?,MALE
LAURA BARTON,You are so cute.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Nat and...and Banner?,MALE
LAURA BARTON,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Oh. Okay.,MALE
LAURA BARTON,"It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,"And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""...",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,You don't think they need me.,MALE
LAURA BARTON,I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Yeah. I guess they're my mess.,MALE
LAURA BARTON,"You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Yes, ma'am.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,I can feel the difference.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.",MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,Do you expect a thank you note?,FEMALE
ULTRON,I expect you to know why.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"The Cradle.  ""This is the next thing, Tony.""",FEMALE
ULTRON,This...is the next me.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.",FEMALE
ULTRON,"It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,I didn't realize you were waiting.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,They used up all the hot water.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I should've joined you.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Missed our window.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Did we?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,What did you dream?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,I think you're being hard on yourself.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Here I was hoping that was your job.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,What are you doing?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Are you out of your mind?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I want you to understand that I'm...,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not a threat to me.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing.  You still think you're the only monster on the team?",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"What, so we disappear?",MALE
TONY STARK,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.",MALE
TONY STARK,Seems like you walked away all right.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is that a problem?,MALE
TONY STARK,I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.,MALE
TONY STARK,Banner and I were doing research.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,That would affect the team.,MALE
TONY STARK,"That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,"I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick.  Don't take from my pile.  Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?",MALE
NICK FURY,Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?",MALE
NICK FURY,Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?",MALE
NICK FURY,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,MALE
TONY STARK,You're not the director of me.,MALE
NICK FURY,"I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.",MALE
TONY STARK,"And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.",MALE
NICK FURY,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.",MALE
NICK FURY,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.",MALE
NICK FURY,The worst part is that you didn't.,MALE
ERIK SELVIG,"I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.",MALE
THOR,I need your help.,MALE
ERIK SELVIG,It's nice to be needed.,MALE
THOR,It's dangerous.,MALE
ERIK SELVIG,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What about Ultron himself?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.",MALE
TONY STARK,He still going after launch codes?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.",MALE
TONY STARK,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,NEXUS?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,So what'd they say?,MALE
NICK FURY,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.",MALE
TONY STARK,By whom?,MALE
NICK FURY,Parties unknown.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do we have an ally?,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown.""",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,"I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know what, Romanoff?",MALE
NICK FURY,So what does he want?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.",FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.",MALE
NICK FURY,How?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...",FEMALE
ULTRON,"The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'll take Natasha and Clint.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,If Ultron is really building a body...,MALE
TONY STARK,He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.,MALE
NICK FURY,I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?,MALE
TONY STARK,"She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?",MALE
NICK FURY,"I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.,MALE
LAURA BARTON,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,No. It's the last project. I promise.,MALE
ERIK SELVIG,This is it. The Water of Sight.,MALE
THOR,"In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.",MALE
ERIK SELVIG,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.",MALE
TONY STARK,"A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.",MALE
WORLD HUB TECH,How do you find it?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me.",MALE
HEIMDALL,Wake up!,MALE
ERIK SELVIG,Thor!,MALE
ULTRON,Extinction.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.",FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I can read him. He is dreaming.,FEMALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...",FEMALE
ULTRON,How soon? I'm not being pushy.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...,FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,How could you?,FEMALE
ULTRON,How could I what?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.",FEMALE
ULTRON,It will be better.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,When everyone is dead.,FEMALE
ULTRON,That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,And if they don't?,MALE
ULTRON,Ask Noah.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're a madman.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,And who decides who's weak?,MALE
ULTRON,Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,That's not a problem.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"Ah, wait, guys!.  They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Two minutes. Stay close.  Dr. Cho!,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,He's uploading himself into the body.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where?,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,"The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,First I have to find it.,MALE
DR. HELEN CHO,Go.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did you guys copy that?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,We did.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron.",MALE
ULTRON,"No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"You're not a match for him, Cap.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thanks, Barton.",MALE
ULTRON,"You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I wouldn't call it a comfort.,MALE
ULTRON,Stop it!,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm always picking up after you boys.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Which way?,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Hard right... Now.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come on!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clint, can you draw out the guards?",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,Let's find out.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Beep beep!,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What do you think I've been doing?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Negative. I am still in the truck.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,What the hell are you...?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.",FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,How do you want me to take it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.",FEMALE
ULTRON,Please. Don't do this.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,What choice do we have?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I lost him! He's headed your way.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Nat, we gotta go.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Nat! Cap, you see Nat?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!",MALE
CLINT BARTON,Do you have eyes on Nat?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Go!  Civilians in our path.  Can you stop this thing?,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm very tempted not to give you one.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"The Cradle, did you get it?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Stark will take care of it.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"No, he won't.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,He will do anything to make things right.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,Anything on Nat?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,This is sealed tight.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, about that.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,No.,MALE
TONY STARK,You have to trust me.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Kinda don't.,MALE
TONY STARK,Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him.,MALE
JARVIS,"Hello, Dr. Banner.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?",MALE
TONY STARK,"No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?,MALE
TONY STARK,"JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.",MALE
JARVIS,I believe it's worth a go.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.",MALE
ULTRON,"I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me… ""…just makes me stronger.""",MALE
TONY STARK,This framework is not compatible.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm gonna say this once.,MALE
TONY STARK,"How about ""nonce""?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Shut it down!,MALE
TONY STARK,"Nope, not gonna happen.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You don't know what you're doing.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,And you do? She's not in your head?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I know you're angry.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Banner, after everything that's happened...",MALE
TONY STARK,That's nothing compared to what's coming!,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You don't know what's in there!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,This isn't a game...,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,The creature...!,FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"No, no. Go on. You were saying?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Pietro!,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,What? You didn't see that coming?,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Go ahead, piss me off.  Wait!",MALE
VISION,"I'm sorry, that was...odd.  Thank you.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thor, you helped create this?",MALE
THOR,I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"What, the gem?",MALE
THOR,"It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then why would you bring it to...,MALE
THOR,Because Stark is right.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, it's definitely the end times.",MALE
THOR,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,MALE
VISION,Not alone.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?",MALE
TONY STARK,We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I think I've had my fill of new.,MALE
VISION,You think I'm a child of Ultron?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You're not?,MALE
VISION,I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I looked in your head and saw annihilation.,FEMALE
VISION,Look again.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.,MALE
THOR,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is it? Are you? On our side?,MALE
VISION,I don't think it's that simple.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Well it better get real simple real soon.,MALE
VISION,"I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.",MALE
TONY STARK,What's he waiting for?,MALE
VISION,You.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Where?,MALE
CLINT BARTON,Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.,MALE
BRUCE BANNER,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...",MALE
VISION,"What will you do?  I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go.",MALE
THOR,Right.  Well done.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Three minutes. Get what you need.,MALE
FRIDAY,"Good evening, boss.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I got no plans tomorrow night.,MALE
TONY STARK,I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,MALE
VISION,"That's true, he hates you the most.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"We're under attack! Clear the city, now!  Get off your asses.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,Natasha! Natasha!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Bruce?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,You alright?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, I did.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,So what's our play?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,I'm here to get you to safety.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Job's not finished.,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,So we just disappear?,FEMALE
FRIDAY,"Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you.",FEMALE
ULTRON,Come to confess your sins?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I don't know, how much time you got?",MALE
ULTRON,More than you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...",MALE
ULTRON,You're stalling to protect the people.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?",MALE
ULTRON,"I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.  What, you think you're the only one stalling?",MALE
FRIDAY,There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Go!,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get off the bridge! Run!,FEMALE
VISION,Ultron.,MALE
ULTRON,My Vision. They really did take everything from me.,MALE
VISION,"You set the terms, you can change them.",MALE
ULTRON,Alright.,MALE
TONY STARK,FRIDAY! The Vision?,MALE
FRIDAY,"Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.",FEMALE
ULTRON,"You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours.",MALE
TONY STARK,FRIDAY?,MALE
FRIDAY,Sokovia's going for a ride.,FEMALE
ULTRON,"Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.",MALE
BRUCE BANNER,We gotta move.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not going to turn green?,FEMALE
BRUCE BANNER,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I adore you.  But I need the other guy.  Let's finish the job.  I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero.,FEMALE
FRIDAY,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,If it drops?,MALE
FRIDAY,"Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction.  That building's not clear, Tenth floor.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Hi. Okay. Get in the tub!,MALE
FRIDAY,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Cap, you got incoming.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Go, go, move!",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,How could I let this happen?,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Hey, hey, you okay?",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,This is all our fault.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,"Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger.  Alright, good chat.  Yeah, the city is flying.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I got you! Just look at me.,MALE
ULTRON,You can't save them all. You'll never...,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You'll never what? You didn't finish!  What, were you napping?",MALE
ULTRON,Thor! You're bothering me.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Alright, we're all clear here.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,We are not clear! We are very not clear!,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Alright, coming to you.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Keep up old man!,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Nobody would know. Nobody. ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.""",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Romanoff!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thanks.,FEMALE
FRIDAY,"The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...,MALE
FRIDAY,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.",MALE
FRIDAY,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.",MALE
TONY STARK,Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Not 'til everyone's safe.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't say we should leave.  There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better.   Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Fury, you son of a bitch.",MALE
NICK FURY,Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?,MALE
MARIA HILL,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.,FEMALE
SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,This is SHIELD?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.,MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,This is not so bad.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Let's load 'em up.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,Show 'em what we got.,MALE
MARIA HILL,You're up.,FEMALE
JAMES RHODES,Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.,MALE
TONY STARK,Yep. If you live to tell it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You think I can't hold my own?,MALE
TONY STARK,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,You had to make it weird.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!",MALE
SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.",MALE
MARIA HILL,Incoming!,FEMALE
SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Oh, God!",MALE
ULTRON,You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.,MALE
THOR,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready?",MALE
VISION,It's terribly well balanced.,MALE
THOR,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.",MALE
TONY STARK,I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.,MALE
FRIDAY,Running numbers.  A heat seal could work with enough power.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Thor, I got a plan!",MALE
THOR,We're out of time. They're coming for the core.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,On it.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Avengers, time to work for a living.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,You good?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini.""",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly.  What's the drill?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.",MALE
THOR,Is that the best you can do?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You had to ask.,MALE
ULTRON,"This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, like the old man said. Together.",MALE
ULTRON,"You know, with the benefit of hindsight....",MALE
THOR,They'll try to leave the city.,MALE
TONY STARK,"We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"I'm on it.  Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ...  Okay, what?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,What about the core?,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'll protect it. It's my job.,FEMALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get the people on the boats.,FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm not going to leave you here.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I can handle this.  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.",FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Hmm.,MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,You understand?,FEMALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,Go.,FEMALE
FRIDAY,"Boss, power levels are way below opt...",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.,FEMALE
CLINT BARTON,No one eats in a dining room.  We don't have a lot of time.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So get your ass on a boat.  Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low.",FEMALE
ZRINKA,Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.",MALE
THOR,Is this the last of them?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.",MALE
THOR,Maybe not.,MALE
ULTRON,"I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone.",MALE
PIETRO MAXIMOFF,You didn't see that coming.,MALE
ULTRON,"Oh, for God's sake!",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"No, no. I'm fine.  Oh, it's been a long day.",MALE
ULTRON,"Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.",MALE
WANDA MAXIMOFF,I just did. Do you know how it felt?  It felt like that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Thor, on my mark.  Now!",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t...",FEMALE
VISION,You're afraid.,MALE
ULTRON,Of you?,MALE
VISION,Of death. You're the last one.,MALE
ULTRON,"You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.",MALE
VISION,I suppose we're both disappointments.,MALE
ULTRON,I suppose we are.,MALE
VISION,"Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.",MALE
ULTRON,They're doomed.,MALE
VISION,Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.,MALE
ULTRON,You're unbearably naive.,MALE
VISION,"Well, I was born yesterday.",MALE
LAURA BARTON,Say hi to Auntie Nat.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fat.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Right.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?",FEMALE
NICK FURY,You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nothing lasts forever.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The rules have changed.,MALE
TONY STARK,We're dealing with something new.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.",MALE
TONY STARK,A machine.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,So it doesn't count.,MALE
TONY STARK,No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right. Different rules for us.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Nice guy, but artificial.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.,MALE
THOR,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...,MALE
TONY STARK,It would still go up.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Elevator's not worthy.,MALE
THOR,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, not if you don't leave.",MALE
THOR,I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...,MALE
TONY STARK,Triple Yahtzee?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You think you can find out what's coming?,MALE
THOR,"I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.",MALE
TONY STARK,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I will miss you, Tony.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The simple life.,MALE
TONY STARK,You'll get there one day.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out.",MALE
TONY STARK,You alright?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I'm home.  You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We've got some hitters.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,They're good. They're not a team.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Let's beat 'em into shape.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Avengers...!,MALE
THANOS,"Fine, I'll do it myself.",MALE
