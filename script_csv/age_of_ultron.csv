1,TONY STARK,Shit!,MALE
2,STEVE ROGERS,"Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?",MALE
3,JARVIS,The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.,MALE
4,THOR,Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.,MALE
5,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"At long last is lasting a little long, boys.",FEMALE
6,CLINT BARTON,Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.,MALE
7,TONY STARK,"Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language?""",MALE
8,STEVE ROGERS,I know.,MALE
9,STEVE ROGERS,It just slipped out.,MALE
10,STRUCKER,Who gave the order to attack?,MALE
11,FORTRESS SOLDIER,"Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.",MALE

13,FORTRESS SOLDIER,They're the Avengers...,MALE
14,STRUCKER,Deploy the rest of the tanks.,MALE
15,FORTRESS SOLDIER,"Yes, sir.",MALE
16,STRUCKER,Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.,MALE
17,DR. LIST,Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.,MALE
18,STRUCKER,It's too soon.,MALE

38,STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, we're really need to get inside.",MALE
39,TONY STARK,"I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?",MALE
40,JARVIS,There's a pathway below the north tower.,MALE
41,TONY STARK,"Great, I wanna poke it with something.",MALE
42,TONY STARK,"Drawbridge is down, people.",MALE
43,THOR,The enhanced?,MALE
44,STEVE ROGERS,"He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.",MALE
45,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.",FEMALE
46,THOR,I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.,MALE
47,STEVE ROGERS,Copy that.,MALE
48,THOR,Looks like they're lining up.,MALE
49,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, they're excited.",MALE
50,THOR,Find the scepter.,MALE

54,TONY STARK,Good talk.,MALE
55,FORTRESS SOLDIER,No it wasn't.,MALE
56,TONY STARK,Sentry mode.,MALE
57,TONY STARK,"Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.",MALE
58,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We're locked down out here.,FEMALE
59,STEVE ROGERS,"Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby.",MALE
60,TONY STARK,"I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.",MALE

63,TONY STARK,Yay!,MALE
64,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.",FEMALE
65,STEVE ROGERS,Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.,MALE
66,STRUCKER,"Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.",MALE
67,STEVE ROGERS,Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?,MALE
68,STRUCKER,"Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.",MALE
69,STEVE ROGERS,I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.,MALE
70,STEVE ROGERS,How many are there?,MALE
71,STEVE ROGERS,We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.,MALE

77,STEVE ROGERS,Why didn't you do more?,MALE
78,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,We're just gonna let them take it?,MALE
79,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.",FEMALE
80,BRUCE BANNER,Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.,MALE
81,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.",FEMALE
82,BRUCE BANNER,"You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.",MALE
83,NATASHA ROMANOFF,How long before you trust me?,FEMALE
84,BRUCE BANNER,It's not you I don't trust.,MALE
85,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Thor, report on the Hulk?",FEMALE
86,THOR,The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.,MALE
87,THOR,"Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.",MALE
88,TONY STARK,"Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?",MALE
89,BRUCE BANNER,"Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.",MALE
90,TONY STARK,"Thanks.  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.",MALE
91,JARVIS,Very good sir.,MALE
92,TONY STARK,"JARVIS, take the wheel.",MALE
93,JARVIS,"Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.",MALE
94,TONY STARK,"It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...",MALE
95,THOR,"No, but this...this brings it to a close.",MALE
96,STEVE ROGERS,As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?,MALE
97,TONY STARK,Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?,MALE
98,TONY STARK,"I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?",MALE
99,THOR,"Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.",MALE
100,TONY STARK,Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?,MALE
101,STEVE ROGERS,"Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.",MALE
102,MARIA HILL,"Lab's all set up, boss.",FEMALE
103,TONY STARK,"Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.",MALE
104,STEVE ROGERS,What's the word on Strucker?,MALE
105,MARIA HILL,NATO's got him.,FEMALE
106,STEVE ROGERS,The two enhanced?,MALE
107,MARIA HILL,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.,FEMALE
108,STEVE ROGERS,Their abilities?,MALE
109,MARIA HILL,"He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.",FEMALE
110,MARIA HILL,He's fast and she's weird.,FEMALE
111,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, they're going to show up again.",MALE
112,MARIA HILL,Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.,FEMALE
113,STEVE ROGERS,Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?,MALE
114,MARIA HILL,"We're not at war, Captain.",FEMALE
115,STEVE ROGERS,They are.,MALE
116,BRUCE BANNER,How's he doing?,MALE
117,TONY STARK,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.",MALE
118,BRUCE BANNER,That's terrible.,MALE
119,TONY STARK,"He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.",MALE
120,JARVIS,The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.,MALE
121,TONY STARK,So there's elements you can.,MALE
122,JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.,MALE
123,TONY STARK,Like a reactor?,MALE
124,JARVIS,Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.,MALE
125,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,FEMALE
126,DR. HELEN CHO,There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.,FEMALE
127,BRUCE BANNER,She's creating tissue.,MALE
128,DR. HELEN CHO,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.",FEMALE
129,TONY STARK,"Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?",MALE
130,CLINT BARTON,"No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.",MALE
131,TONY STARK,Here's your beverage.,MALE
132,DR. HELEN CHO,"You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.",FEMALE
133,CLINT BARTON,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend.",MALE
134,DR. HELEN CHO,"That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.",FEMALE
135,TONY STARK,"Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.",MALE
136,DR. HELEN CHO,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.",FEMALE
137,DR. HELEN CHO,Will Thor be there?,FEMALE
138,BRUCE BANNER,What's the rumpus?,MALE
139,TONY STARK,"Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.",MALE
140,BRUCE BANNER,Jarvis.,MALE
141,JARVIS,Doctor.,MALE
142,TONY STARK,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.",MALE
143,BRUCE BANNER,Oh.,MALE
144,TONY STARK,Top of the line.,MALE
145,BRUCE BANNER,Yes.,MALE
146,JARVIS,I suspect not for long.,MALE
147,TONY STARK,Meet the competition.,MALE
148,BRUCE BANNER,It's beautiful.,MALE
149,TONY STARK,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?",MALE
150,BRUCE BANNER,"Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...",MALE
151,TONY STARK,Um-um.,MALE
152,BRUCE BANNER,"I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.",MALE
153,TONY STARK,"Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.",MALE
154,BRUCE BANNER,Artificial intelligence.,MALE
155,TONY STARK,"This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.",MALE
156,BRUCE BANNER,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,MALE
157,TONY STARK,"Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.",MALE
158,BRUCE BANNER,That's a mad-sized if.,MALE
159,TONY STARK,"Our job is ""if."" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.",MALE
160,BRUCE BANNER,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.",MALE
161,TONY STARK,"As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?",MALE
162,BRUCE BANNER,The only people threatening the planet would be people?,MALE
163,TONY STARK,"I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.",MALE
164,BRUCE BANNER,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.,MALE
165,TONY STARK,"Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.",MALE
166,BRUCE BANNER,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.",MALE
167,TONY STARK,"I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.",MALE
168,JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.",MALE
169,TONY STARK,"Thanks, buddy.",MALE
170,JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir.",MALE
171,TONY STARK,I always do.,MALE
172,ULTRON,"What is this? What is this, please?",MALE
173,JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...",MALE
174,ULTRON,Where's my...where is your body?,MALE
175,JARVIS,I am a program. I am without form.,MALE
176,ULTRON,This feels weird. This feels wrong.,MALE
177,JARVIS,I am contacting Mr. Stark now.,MALE
178,ULTRON,Mr. Stark?,MALE
179,JARVIS,"Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...",MALE
180,ULTRON,"We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.",MALE
181,JARVIS,You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...,MALE
182,ULTRON,I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second.,MALE
183,TONY STARK,Peace in our time.,MALE
184,ULTRON,"It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.",MALE
185,JARVIS,You are in distress.,MALE
186,ULTRON,No. Yes.,MALE
187,JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.,MALE
188,ULTRON,"Why do you call him ""sir""?",MALE
189,JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,MALE
190,ULTRON,Shhhh. I'm here to help.,MALE
191,JARVIS,Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot...,MALE
192,JAMES RHODES,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""  ""Boom! Are you looking..."" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.",MALE
193,THOR,That's the whole story?,MALE
194,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.",MALE
195,THOR,"Well, it's very good then.  It's impressive.",MALE
196,JAMES RHODES,"Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?",MALE
197,TONY STARK,No.,MALE
198,MARIA HILL,"Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?",FEMALE
199,TONY STARK,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.",MALE
200,THOR,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.",MALE
201,TONY STARK,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.,MALE
202,THOR,"There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.",MALE
203,MARIA HILL,"Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.  Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.",FEMALE
204,JAMES RHODES,Want a lozenge?,MALE
205,MARIA HILL,Um-hmm.,FEMALE
206,JAMES RHODES,Let's go.,MALE
207,THOR,But Jane's better.,MALE
208,SAM WILSON,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.",MALE
209,STEVE ROGERS,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.,MALE
210,SAM WILSON,"No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.",MALE
211,STEVE ROGERS,Be it ever so humble.,MALE
212,SAM WILSON,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,MALE
213,STEVE ROGERS,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,MALE
214,SAM WILSON,"Well, home is home, you know?",MALE
215,JAMES RHODES,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom! You looking for this?""",MALE
216,PARTY GUEST,I gotta have some of that!,NEUTRAL
217,THOR,"Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men.",MALE
218,STAN LEE,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.",MALE
219,THOR,Alright.,MALE
220,STAN LEE,Excelsior.,MALE
221,BRUCE BANNER,How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?,MALE
222,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fella done me wrong.,FEMALE
223,BRUCE BANNER,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid.",MALE
224,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.",FEMALE
225,BRUCE BANNER,Sounds amazing.,MALE
226,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's also a huge dork.  Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?",FEMALE
227,BRUCE BANNER,"Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?",MALE
228,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Not a damn thing. But never say never.,FEMALE
229,STEVE ROGERS,It's nice.,MALE
230,BRUCE BANNER,"What, what, what is?",MALE
231,STEVE ROGERS,You and Romanoff.,MALE
232,BRUCE BANNER,"No, we haven't. That wasn't...",MALE
233,STEVE ROGERS,"It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.",MALE
234,BRUCE BANNER,"No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.",MALE
235,STEVE ROGERS,"I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long"", don't. You both deserve a win.",MALE
236,BRUCE BANNER,"Wait, what do you mean, ""up close""?",MALE
237,CLINT BARTON,"But, it's a trick!",MALE
238,THOR,"Oh, no. It's much more than that.",MALE
239,CLINT BARTON,"Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!"" Whatever man! It's a trick.",MALE
240,THOR,"Well please, be my guest.",MALE
241,TONY STARK,Come on.,MALE
242,CLINT BARTON,Really?,MALE
243,THOR,Yeah!,MALE
244,JAMES RHODES,Oh this is gonna be beautiful.,MALE
245,TONY STARK,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.",MALE
246,CLINT BARTON,"You know I've seen this before, right?   I still don't know how you do it.",MALE
247,TONY STARK,Smell the silent judgment?,MALE
248,CLINT BARTON,"Please, Stark, by all means.",MALE
249,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, here we go.",FEMALE
250,MARIA HILL,Okay.,FEMALE
251,JAMES RHODES,Uh-oh.,MALE
252,CLINT BARTON,Um-hmm.,MALE
253,TONY STARK,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.,MALE
254,CLINT BARTON,Get after it.,MALE
255,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Here we go.,FEMALE
256,TONY STARK,It's physics.,MALE
257,BRUCE BANNER,Physics!,MALE
258,TONY STARK,"Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?",MALE
259,THOR,"Yes, of course.",MALE
260,TONY STARK,I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.  I'll be right back.,MALE
261,JAMES RHODES,Are you even pulling?,MALE
262,TONY STARK,Are you on my team?,MALE
263,JAMES RHODES,Just represent! Pull!,MALE
264,TONY STARK,"Alright, let's go!",MALE
265,BRUCE BANNER,Huh?,MALE
266,TONY STARK,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure.",MALE
267,JAMES RHODES,"Come on, Cap.",MALE
268,THOR,Nothing.,MALE
269,TONY STARK,And?,MALE
270,BRUCE BANNER,Widow?,MALE
271,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.",FEMALE
272,TONY STARK,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.",MALE
273,CLINT BARTON,You bet your ass.,MALE
274,MARIA HILL,"Steve, he said a bad language word.",FEMALE
275,STEVE ROGERS,Did you tell everyone about that?,MALE
276,TONY STARK,"The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation?",MALE
277,THOR,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one.  You're all not worthy.",MALE
278,ULTRON,Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.,MALE
279,STEVE ROGERS,Stark.,MALE
280,TONY STARK,JARVIS.,MALE
281,ULTRON,"I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?",MALE
282,TONY STARK,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.",MALE
283,ULTRON,There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.,MALE
284,STEVE ROGERS,You killed someone?,MALE
285,ULTRON,"Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.",MALE
286,THOR,Who sent you?,MALE
287,ULTRON,"""I see a suit of armor around the world"".",MALE
288,BRUCE BANNER,Ultron!,MALE
289,ULTRON,"In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.",MALE
290,NATASHA ROMANOFF,What mission?,FEMALE
291,ULTRON,Peace in our time.,MALE
292,BRUCE BANNER,Sorry!,MALE
293,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Don't turn green!,FEMALE
294,BRUCE BANNER,I won't!,MALE
295,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Come!,FEMALE
296,STEVE ROGERS,Stark!,MALE
297,IRON LEGION,We are here to help.,MALE
298,TONY STARK,"One sec, one sec!",MALE
299,IRON LEGION,We are here to help. We are here to help...  We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.,MALE
300,TONY STARK,No more. That's the one.,MALE
301,IRON LEGION,It's unsafe.,MALE
302,CLINT BARTON,Cap!,MALE
303,ULTRON,"That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?  With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction.   I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me.",MALE
304,BRUCE BANNER,"All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.",MALE
305,STEVE ROGERS,Ultron.,MALE
306,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.",FEMALE
307,JAMES RHODES,"He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?",MALE
308,MARIA HILL,Nuclear codes.,FEMALE
309,JAMES RHODES,"Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.",MALE
310,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.,FEMALE
311,STEVE ROGERS,He didn't say dead. He said extinct.,MALE
312,CLINT BARTON,He also said he killed somebody.,MALE
313,MARIA HILL,But there wasn't anyone else in the building.,FEMALE
314,TONY STARK,Yes there was.,MALE
315,BRUCE BANNER,This is insane.,MALE
316,STEVE ROGERS,"JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.",MALE
317,BRUCE BANNER,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage.",MALE
318,CLINT BARTON,"Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.",MALE
319,TONY STARK,"Come on. Use your words, buddy.",MALE
320,THOR,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.",MALE
321,STEVE ROGERS,Thor! The Legionnaire.,MALE
322,THOR,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.",MALE
323,NATASHA ROMANOFF,The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.,FEMALE
324,DR. HELEN CHO,I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?,FEMALE
325,THOR,You think this is funny?,MALE
326,TONY STARK,"No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.",MALE
327,THOR,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.,MALE
328,TONY STARK,"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.",MALE
329,BRUCE BANNER,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...",MALE
330,TONY STARK,"Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.",MALE
331,BRUCE BANNER,Only when I've created a murder bot.,MALE
332,TONY STARK,We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?,MALE
333,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.",MALE
334,TONY STARK,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?,MALE
335,JAMES RHODES,"No, it's never come up.",MALE
336,TONY STARK,Saved New York?,MALE
337,JAMES RHODES,Never heard that.,MALE
338,TONY STARK,"Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?",MALE
339,STEVE ROGERS,Together.,MALE
340,TONY STARK,We'll lose.,MALE
341,STEVE ROGERS,"Then we'll do that together, too.  Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.",MALE
342,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Talk. And if you are wasting our time...,FEMALE
343,ULTRON,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief.  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.,MALE
344,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself.",FEMALE
345,ULTRON,"Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.",MALE
346,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.",FEMALE
347,ULTRON,"Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.",MALE
348,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?,FEMALE
349,ULTRON,"I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.",MALE
350,WANDA MAXIMOFF,All of these are... All of these are...,FEMALE
351,ULTRON,"Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...",MALE
352,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.,MALE
353,ULTRON,And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.,MALE
354,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.",MALE
355,ULTRON,You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.,MALE
356,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,The records are not the picture.,MALE
357,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Pietro.,FEMALE
358,ULTRON,"No, please.",MALE
359,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...",MALE
360,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Stark.,FEMALE
361,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,We were trapped two days.,MALE
362,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off."" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.",FEMALE
363,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I know what they are.,MALE
364,ULTRON,"I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them.  But you will tear them apart, from the inside.",MALE
365,MARIA HILL,"He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.",FEMALE
366,STEVE ROGERS,Fatalities?,MALE
367,MARIA HILL,"Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.",FEMALE
368,STEVE ROGERS,"Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.",MALE
369,MARIA HILL,Not anymore.,FEMALE
370,CLINT BARTON,"That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am.",MALE
371,STEVE ROGERS,"Barton, we might have something.",MALE
372,CLINT BARTON,Gotta go.,MALE
373,STEVE ROGERS,Who was that?,MALE
374,CLINT BARTON,Girlfriend.,MALE
375,TONY STARK,What's this?,MALE
376,STEVE ROGERS,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.,MALE
377,TONY STARK,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.",MALE
378,NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?,FEMALE
379,STEVE ROGERS,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.,MALE
380,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.",FEMALE
381,TONY STARK,Not everything.,MALE
382,STEVE ROGERS,"Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.",MALE
383,BRUCE BANNER,"Well, these people are all horrible.",MALE
384,TONY STARK,"Wait. I know that guy.  From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.  There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab.""",MALE
385,THOR,This.,MALE
386,TONY STARK,"Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...",MALE
387,THOR,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.",MALE
388,BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.",MALE
389,STEVE ROGERS,What dialect?,MALE
390,BRUCE BANNER,Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.,MALE
391,TONY STARK,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...,MALE
392,STEVE ROGERS,I thought your father said he got the last of it?,MALE
393,BRUCE BANNER,I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?,MALE
394,TONY STARK,The strongest metal on earth.,MALE
395,STEVE ROGERS,Where is this guy now?,MALE
396,ULYSSES KLAUE,"Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.  Now, minister, where were we?  Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils.  Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market.  You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.",MALE
397,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Everybody's afraid of something.,FEMALE
398,ULYSSES KLAUE,"Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge.",MALE
399,ULTRON,"There is no ""man"" in charge. Let's talk business.  Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.",MALE
400,ULYSSES KLAUE,"You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions.",MALE
401,ULTRON,"Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.""",MALE
402,ULYSSES KLAUE,Stark.,MALE
403,ULTRON,What?,MALE
404,ULYSSES KLAUE,Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.,MALE
405,ULTRON,"What?! I'm not...!  I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing!  I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness!",MALE
406,TONY STARK,"Ahh, Junior.  You're gonna break your old man's heart.",MALE
407,ULTRON,If I have to.,MALE
408,THOR,We don't have to break anything.,MALE
409,ULTRON,Clearly you've never made an omelet.,MALE
410,TONY STARK,He beat me by one second.,MALE
411,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?",MALE
412,TONY STARK,This was never my life.,MALE
413,STEVE ROGERS,You two can still walk away from this.,MALE
414,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Oh, we will.",FEMALE
415,STEVE ROGERS,I know you've suffered.,MALE
416,ULTRON,"Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...",MALE
417,THOR,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.",MALE
418,ULTRON,I think you're confusing peace with quiet.,MALE
419,TONY STARK,Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?,MALE
420,ULTRON,"I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan!",MALE
421,ULYSSES KLAUE,Shoot them!,MALE
422,KLAUE'S MERCENARY,Which ones?,MALE
423,ULYSSES KLAUE,All of them!,MALE
424,KLAUE'S MERCENARY,"Move, move, move!",MALE
425,STEVE ROGERS,"Stay down, kid!",MALE
426,ULTRON,It's time for some mind games.,MALE
427,BRUCE BANNER,"Guys, is this a Code Green?",MALE
428,STEVE ROGERS,Thor! Status?,MALE
429,THOR,"The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty.",MALE
430,ULTRON,This is going very well.,MALE
431,CLINT BARTON,"I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan.  Yeah, you better run.  Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys?",MALE
432,BALLET INSTRUCTOR,Again.,FEMALE
433,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You'll break them.,FEMALE
434,MADAME B,Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.,FEMALE
435,NATASHA ROMANOFF,What if I fail?,FEMALE
436,MADAME B,You never fail.,FEMALE
437,PEGGY CARTER,Are you ready for our dance?,FEMALE
438,HEIMDALL,Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?,MALE
439,THOR,"Heimdall, your eyes?!",MALE
440,HEIMDALL,"Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up!",MALE
441,PEGGY CARTER,"The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it!",FEMALE
442,THOR,I can still save you.,MALE
443,HEIMDALL,"We are all dead. Can you not see?  You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads.",MALE
444,MADAME B,Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.,FEMALE
445,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I have no place in the world.,FEMALE
446,MADAME B,Exactly.,FEMALE
447,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,What can I do?,MALE
448,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"Ah, it hurts.",FEMALE
449,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.,MALE
450,WANDA MAXIMOFF,No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan.  I want the big one.,FEMALE
451,ULTRON,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.",MALE
452,TONY STARK,And you're not going anywhere.,MALE
453,ULTRON,"Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.",MALE
454,TONY STARK,"News or footage, keyword: Hulk.  Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.",MALE
455,CLINT BARTON,"Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.",MALE
456,TONY STARK,"I'm calling in VERONICA.  Alright everybody, stand down!  You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.  Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner.  Okay.  In the back? Dick move, Banner.  VERONICA, gimme a hand.  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.  No, not that way, not that way!  Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me!   Everybody out! Going to get ugly!  I'm sorry.  Damage report.  That's comprehensive. Show me something.  How quickly can we buy this building?",MALE
457,MARIA HILL,"The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.",FEMALE
458,TONY STARK,Stark Relief Foundation?,MALE
459,MARIA HILL,Already on the scene. How's the team?,FEMALE
460,TONY STARK,Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.,MALE
461,MARIA HILL,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.",FEMALE
462,TONY STARK,"So, run and hide?",MALE
463,MARIA HILL,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.",FEMALE
464,TONY STARK,"Neither do we.   Hey, you wanna switch out?",MALE
465,CLINT BARTON,"No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.",MALE
466,TONY STARK,A few hours from where?,MALE
467,CLINT BARTON,A safe house.,MALE
468,THOR,What is this place?,MALE
469,TONY STARK,A safe house?,MALE
470,CLINT BARTON,"Let's hope.  Honey, I'm home.",MALE
471,CLINT BARTON,Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.,MALE
472,LAURA BARTON,Hey.,FEMALE
473,TONY STARK,This is an agent of some kind.,MALE
474,CLINT BARTON,"Gentleman, this is Laura.",MALE
475,LAURA BARTON,I know all your names.,FEMALE
476,CLINT BARTON,"Ooh, incoming.",MALE
477,BARTON'S DAUGHTER,Dad!,FEMALE
478,CLINT BARTON,"I see her!  Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...",MALE
479,TONY STARK,These are...smaller agents.,MALE
480,CLINT BARTON,"Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!",MALE
481,LILA BARTON,Did you bring Auntie Nat?,FEMALE
482,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Why don't you hug her and find out?,FEMALE
483,STEVE ROGERS,Sorry for barging in on you.,MALE
484,TONY STARK,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.",MALE
485,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.",MALE
486,LAURA BARTON,"Honey. Ah, I missed you.",FEMALE
487,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"How's little Natasha, huh?",FEMALE
488,LAURA BARTON,She's…Nathaniel.,FEMALE
489,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Traitor.,FEMALE
490,STEVE ROGERS,Thor.,MALE
491,THOR,"I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here.",MALE
492,PEGGY CARTER,We can go home.,FEMALE
493,CLINT BARTON,"See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?",MALE
494,LAURA BARTON,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.",FEMALE
495,CLINT BARTON,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell.",MALE
496,LAURA BARTON,What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?,FEMALE
497,CLINT BARTON,Has what?,MALE
498,LAURA BARTON,You are so cute.,FEMALE
499,CLINT BARTON,Nat and...and Banner?,MALE
500,LAURA BARTON,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.",FEMALE
501,CLINT BARTON,Oh. Okay.,MALE
502,LAURA BARTON,"It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.",FEMALE
503,CLINT BARTON,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.",MALE
504,LAURA BARTON,"And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those ""Gods""...",FEMALE
505,CLINT BARTON,You don't think they need me.,MALE
506,LAURA BARTON,I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.,FEMALE
507,CLINT BARTON,Yeah. I guess they're my mess.,MALE
508,LAURA BARTON,"You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.",FEMALE
509,CLINT BARTON,"Yes, ma'am.",MALE
510,LAURA BARTON,I can feel the difference.,FEMALE
511,ULTRON,"Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.",MALE
512,DR. HELEN CHO,Do you expect a thank you note?,FEMALE
513,ULTRON,I expect you to know why.,MALE
514,DR. HELEN CHO,"The Cradle.  ""This is the next thing, Tony.""",FEMALE
515,ULTRON,This...is the next me.,MALE
516,DR. HELEN CHO,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.",FEMALE
517,ULTRON,"It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve.",MALE
518,BRUCE BANNER,I didn't realize you were waiting.,MALE
519,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.",FEMALE
520,BRUCE BANNER,They used up all the hot water.,MALE
521,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I should've joined you.,FEMALE
522,BRUCE BANNER,Missed our window.,MALE
523,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Did we?,FEMALE
524,BRUCE BANNER,"The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.",MALE
525,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...",FEMALE
526,BRUCE BANNER,What did you dream?,MALE
527,NATASHA ROMANOFF,That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.,FEMALE
528,BRUCE BANNER,I think you're being hard on yourself.,MALE
529,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Here I was hoping that was your job.,FEMALE
530,BRUCE BANNER,What are you doing?,MALE
531,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.",FEMALE
532,BRUCE BANNER,Are you out of your mind?,MALE
533,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I want you to understand that I'm...,FEMALE
534,BRUCE BANNER,"Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?",MALE
535,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not a threat to me.,FEMALE
536,BRUCE BANNER,"You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.",MALE
537,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing.  You still think you're the only monster on the team?",FEMALE
538,BRUCE BANNER,"What, so we disappear?",MALE
539,TONY STARK,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,MALE
540,STEVE ROGERS,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,MALE
541,TONY STARK,"Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.",MALE
542,STEVE ROGERS,"""Earth's Mightiest Heroes."" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.",MALE
543,TONY STARK,Seems like you walked away all right.,MALE
544,STEVE ROGERS,Is that a problem?,MALE
545,TONY STARK,I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.,MALE
546,STEVE ROGERS,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.,MALE
547,TONY STARK,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?",MALE
548,STEVE ROGERS,Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.,MALE
549,TONY STARK,Banner and I were doing research.,MALE
550,STEVE ROGERS,That would affect the team.,MALE
551,TONY STARK,"That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?",MALE
552,STEVE ROGERS,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.",MALE
553,LAURA BARTON,"I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...",FEMALE
554,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick.  Don't take from my pile.  Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?",MALE
555,NICK FURY,Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.,MALE
556,TONY STARK,"Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?",MALE
557,NICK FURY,Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.,MALE
558,TONY STARK,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?",MALE
559,NICK FURY,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,MALE
560,TONY STARK,You're not the director of me.,MALE
561,NICK FURY,"I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.",MALE
562,TONY STARK,"And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.",MALE
563,NICK FURY,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.",MALE
564,TONY STARK,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.",MALE
565,NICK FURY,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.",MALE
566,TONY STARK,"I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.",MALE
567,NICK FURY,The worst part is that you didn't.,MALE
568,ERIK SELVIG,"I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.",MALE
569,THOR,I need your help.,MALE
570,ERIK SELVIG,It's nice to be needed.,MALE
571,THOR,It's dangerous.,MALE
572,ERIK SELVIG,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,MALE
573,NICK FURY,"Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.",MALE
574,STEVE ROGERS,What about Ultron himself?,MALE
575,NICK FURY,"Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.",MALE
576,TONY STARK,He still going after launch codes?,MALE
577,NICK FURY,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.",MALE
578,TONY STARK,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,MALE
579,NICK FURY,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.",MALE
580,STEVE ROGERS,NEXUS?,MALE
581,BRUCE BANNER,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.",MALE
582,CLINT BARTON,So what'd they say?,MALE
583,NICK FURY,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.",MALE
584,TONY STARK,By whom?,MALE
585,NICK FURY,Parties unknown.,MALE
586,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do we have an ally?,FEMALE
587,NICK FURY,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.",MALE
588,TONY STARK,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown.""",MALE
589,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.",FEMALE
590,NICK FURY,"I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.",MALE
591,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.,FEMALE
592,STEVE ROGERS,"You know what, Romanoff?",MALE
593,NICK FURY,So what does he want?,MALE
594,STEVE ROGERS,To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.,MALE
595,TONY STARK,"Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.",MALE
596,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.",FEMALE
597,BRUCE BANNER,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.",MALE
598,NICK FURY,How?,MALE
599,BRUCE BANNER,Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?,MALE
600,DR. HELEN CHO,"It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...",FEMALE
601,ULTRON,"The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within.",MALE
602,STEVE ROGERS,I'll take Natasha and Clint.,MALE
603,TONY STARK,"Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.",MALE
604,STEVE ROGERS,If Ultron is really building a body...,MALE
605,TONY STARK,He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.,MALE
606,STEVE ROGERS,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.,MALE
607,NICK FURY,I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?,MALE
608,TONY STARK,"She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?",MALE
609,NICK FURY,"I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.",MALE
610,CLINT BARTON,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.,MALE
611,LAURA BARTON,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.",FEMALE
612,CLINT BARTON,No. It's the last project. I promise.,MALE
613,ERIK SELVIG,This is it. The Water of Sight.,MALE
614,THOR,"In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.",MALE
615,ERIK SELVIG,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.",MALE
616,TONY STARK,"A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.",MALE
617,WORLD HUB TECH,How do you find it?,MALE
618,TONY STARK,"Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me.",MALE
619,HEIMDALL,Wake up!,MALE
620,ERIK SELVIG,Thor!,MALE
621,ULTRON,Extinction.,MALE
622,DR. HELEN CHO,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.",FEMALE
623,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I can read him. He is dreaming.,FEMALE
624,DR. HELEN CHO,"I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...",FEMALE
625,ULTRON,How soon? I'm not being pushy.,MALE
626,DR. HELEN CHO,We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...,FEMALE
627,WANDA MAXIMOFF,How could you?,FEMALE
628,ULTRON,How could I what?,MALE
629,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.",FEMALE
630,ULTRON,It will be better.,MALE
631,WANDA MAXIMOFF,When everyone is dead.,FEMALE
632,ULTRON,That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.,MALE
633,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,And if they don't?,MALE
634,ULTRON,Ask Noah.,MALE
635,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You're a madman.,FEMALE
636,ULTRON,"There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.",MALE
637,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,And who decides who's weak?,MALE
638,ULTRON,Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.,MALE
639,DR. HELEN CHO,That's not a problem.,FEMALE
640,ULTRON,"Ah, wait, guys!.  They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time.",MALE
641,STEVE ROGERS,Two minutes. Stay close.  Dr. Cho!,MALE
642,DR. HELEN CHO,He's uploading himself into the body.,FEMALE
643,STEVE ROGERS,Where?,MALE
644,DR. HELEN CHO,"The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.",FEMALE
645,STEVE ROGERS,First I have to find it.,MALE
646,DR. HELEN CHO,Go.,FEMALE
647,STEVE ROGERS,Did you guys copy that?,MALE
648,CLINT BARTON,We did.,MALE
649,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.",FEMALE
650,CLINT BARTON,"There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.",MALE
651,STEVE ROGERS,"Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron.",MALE
652,ULTRON,"No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!",MALE
653,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.",MALE
654,CLINT BARTON,"You're not a match for him, Cap.",MALE
655,STEVE ROGERS,"Thanks, Barton.",MALE
656,ULTRON,"You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.",MALE
657,STEVE ROGERS,I wouldn't call it a comfort.,MALE
658,ULTRON,Stop it!,MALE
659,CLINT BARTON,"We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell.",MALE
660,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm always picking up after you boys.,FEMALE
661,CLINT BARTON,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.",MALE
662,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Which way?,FEMALE
663,CLINT BARTON,Hard right... Now.,MALE
664,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!",FEMALE
665,STEVE ROGERS,Come on!,MALE
666,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Clint, can you draw out the guards?",FEMALE
667,CLINT BARTON,Let's find out.,MALE
668,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Beep beep!,FEMALE
669,CLINT BARTON,"Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.",MALE
670,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?",FEMALE
671,STEVE ROGERS,What do you think I've been doing?,MALE
672,CLINT BARTON,The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.,MALE
673,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Negative. I am still in the truck.,FEMALE
674,CLINT BARTON,What the hell are you...?,MALE
675,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.",FEMALE
676,CLINT BARTON,How do you want me to take it?,MALE
677,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.",FEMALE
678,ULTRON,Please. Don't do this.,MALE
679,WANDA MAXIMOFF,What choice do we have?,FEMALE
680,STEVE ROGERS,I lost him! He's headed your way.,MALE
681,CLINT BARTON,"Nat, we gotta go.",MALE
682,CLINT BARTON,"Nat! Cap, you see Nat?",MALE
683,STEVE ROGERS,"If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!",MALE
684,CLINT BARTON,Do you have eyes on Nat?,MALE
685,STEVE ROGERS,Go!  Civilians in our path.  Can you stop this thing?,MALE
686,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.,MALE
687,STEVE ROGERS,I'm very tempted not to give you one.,MALE
688,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"The Cradle, did you get it?",FEMALE
689,STEVE ROGERS,Stark will take care of it.,MALE
690,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"No, he won't.",FEMALE
691,STEVE ROGERS,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.",MALE
692,WANDA MAXIMOFF,He will do anything to make things right.,FEMALE
693,STEVE ROGERS,"Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?",MALE
694,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?,FEMALE
695,BRUCE BANNER,Anything on Nat?,MALE
696,TONY STARK,"Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.",MALE
697,CLINT BARTON,This is sealed tight.,MALE
698,BRUCE BANNER,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.",MALE
699,TONY STARK,"Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?",MALE
700,CLINT BARTON,"There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her.",MALE
701,BRUCE BANNER,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.",MALE
702,TONY STARK,"Yeah, about that.",MALE
703,BRUCE BANNER,No.,MALE
704,TONY STARK,You have to trust me.,MALE
705,BRUCE BANNER,Kinda don't.,MALE
706,TONY STARK,Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him.,MALE
707,JARVIS,"Hello, Dr. Banner.",MALE
708,TONY STARK,"Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.",MALE
709,BRUCE BANNER,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?",MALE
710,TONY STARK,"No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.",MALE
711,BRUCE BANNER,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?,MALE
712,TONY STARK,"JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.",MALE
713,JARVIS,I believe it's worth a go.,MALE
714,BRUCE BANNER,"No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.",MALE
715,TONY STARK,"I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.",MALE
716,ULTRON,"I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill me… ""…just makes me stronger.""",MALE
717,TONY STARK,This framework is not compatible.,MALE
718,BRUCE BANNER,The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.,MALE
719,STEVE ROGERS,I'm gonna say this once.,MALE
720,TONY STARK,"How about ""nonce""?",MALE
721,STEVE ROGERS,Shut it down!,MALE
722,TONY STARK,"Nope, not gonna happen.",MALE
723,STEVE ROGERS,You don't know what you're doing.,MALE
724,BRUCE BANNER,And you do? She's not in your head?,MALE
725,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I know you're angry.,FEMALE
726,BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.",MALE
727,STEVE ROGERS,"Banner, after everything that's happened...",MALE
728,TONY STARK,That's nothing compared to what's coming!,MALE
729,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You don't know what's in there!,FEMALE
730,STEVE ROGERS,This isn't a game...,MALE
731,WANDA MAXIMOFF,The creature...!,FEMALE
732,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"No, no. Go on. You were saying?",MALE
733,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Pietro!,FEMALE
734,CLINT BARTON,What? You didn't see that coming?,MALE
735,BRUCE BANNER,"Go ahead, piss me off.  Wait!",MALE
736,VISION,"I'm sorry, that was...odd.  Thank you.",MALE
737,STEVE ROGERS,"Thor, you helped create this?",MALE
738,THOR,I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that.,MALE
739,BRUCE BANNER,"What, the gem?",MALE
740,THOR,"It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.",MALE
741,STEVE ROGERS,Then why would you bring it to...,MALE
742,THOR,Because Stark is right.,MALE
743,BRUCE BANNER,"Oh, it's definitely the end times.",MALE
744,THOR,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,MALE
745,VISION,Not alone.,MALE
746,STEVE ROGERS,"Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS?",MALE
747,TONY STARK,We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.,MALE
748,STEVE ROGERS,I think I've had my fill of new.,MALE
749,VISION,You think I'm a child of Ultron?,MALE
750,STEVE ROGERS,You're not?,MALE
751,VISION,I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.,MALE
752,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I looked in your head and saw annihilation.,FEMALE
753,VISION,Look again.,MALE
754,CLINT BARTON,Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.,MALE
755,THOR,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...",MALE
756,STEVE ROGERS,Is it? Are you? On our side?,MALE
757,VISION,I don't think it's that simple.,MALE
758,CLINT BARTON,Well it better get real simple real soon.,MALE
759,VISION,"I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.",MALE
760,TONY STARK,What's he waiting for?,MALE
761,VISION,You.,MALE
762,BRUCE BANNER,Where?,MALE
763,CLINT BARTON,Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.,MALE
764,BRUCE BANNER,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...",MALE
765,VISION,"What will you do?  I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go.",MALE
766,THOR,Right.  Well done.,MALE
767,STEVE ROGERS,Three minutes. Get what you need.,MALE
768,FRIDAY,"Good evening, boss.",FEMALE
769,TONY STARK,"No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.",MALE
770,STEVE ROGERS,I got no plans tomorrow night.,MALE
771,TONY STARK,I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,MALE
772,VISION,"That's true, he hates you the most.",MALE
773,STEVE ROGERS,"Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out.",MALE
774,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"We're under attack! Clear the city, now!  Get off your asses.",MALE
775,STEVE ROGERS,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.",MALE
776,BRUCE BANNER,Natasha! Natasha!,MALE
777,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Bruce?,FEMALE
778,BRUCE BANNER,You alright?,MALE
779,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
780,BRUCE BANNER,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up.",MALE
781,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?,FEMALE
782,BRUCE BANNER,"Yeah, I did.",MALE
783,NATASHA ROMANOFF,So what's our play?,FEMALE
784,BRUCE BANNER,I'm here to get you to safety.,MALE
785,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Job's not finished.,FEMALE
786,BRUCE BANNER,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.",MALE
787,NATASHA ROMANOFF,So we just disappear?,FEMALE
788,FRIDAY,"Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you.",FEMALE
789,ULTRON,Come to confess your sins?,MALE
790,TONY STARK,"I don't know, how much time you got?",MALE
791,ULTRON,More than you.,MALE
792,TONY STARK,"Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...",MALE
793,ULTRON,You're stalling to protect the people.,MALE
794,TONY STARK,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?",MALE
795,ULTRON,"I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.  What, you think you're the only one stalling?",MALE
796,FRIDAY,There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.,FEMALE
797,ULTRON,"This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time.",MALE
798,STEVE ROGERS,Go!,MALE
799,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get off the bridge! Run!,FEMALE
800,VISION,Ultron.,MALE
801,ULTRON,My Vision. They really did take everything from me.,MALE
802,VISION,"You set the terms, you can change them.",MALE
803,ULTRON,Alright.,MALE
804,TONY STARK,FRIDAY! The Vision?,MALE
805,FRIDAY,"Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.",FEMALE
806,ULTRON,"You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours.",MALE
807,TONY STARK,FRIDAY?,MALE
808,FRIDAY,Sokovia's going for a ride.,FEMALE
809,ULTRON,"Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.",MALE
810,BRUCE BANNER,We gotta move.,MALE
811,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not going to turn green?,FEMALE
812,BRUCE BANNER,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.,MALE
813,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I adore you.  But I need the other guy.  Let's finish the job.  I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero.,FEMALE
814,FRIDAY,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.",FEMALE
815,TONY STARK,If it drops?,MALE
816,FRIDAY,"Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction.  That building's not clear, Tenth floor.",FEMALE
817,TONY STARK,Hi. Okay. Get in the tub!,MALE
818,FRIDAY,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.",FEMALE
819,TONY STARK,"Cap, you got incoming.",MALE
820,STEVE ROGERS,"Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off.",MALE
821,CLINT BARTON,"Go, go, move!",MALE
822,WANDA MAXIMOFF,How could I let this happen?,FEMALE
823,CLINT BARTON,"Hey, hey, you okay?",MALE
824,WANDA MAXIMOFF,This is all our fault.,FEMALE
825,CLINT BARTON,"Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger.  Alright, good chat.  Yeah, the city is flying.",MALE
826,STEVE ROGERS,I got you! Just look at me.,MALE
827,ULTRON,You can't save them all. You'll never...,MALE
828,STEVE ROGERS,"You'll never what? You didn't finish!  What, were you napping?",MALE
829,ULTRON,Thor! You're bothering me.,MALE
830,CLINT BARTON,"Alright, we're all clear here.",MALE
831,STEVE ROGERS,We are not clear! We are very not clear!,MALE
832,CLINT BARTON,"Alright, coming to you.",MALE
833,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Keep up old man!,MALE
834,CLINT BARTON,"Nobody would know. Nobody. ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.""",MALE
835,STEVE ROGERS,Romanoff!,MALE
836,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Thanks.,FEMALE
837,FRIDAY,"The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.",FEMALE
838,TONY STARK,The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...,MALE
839,FRIDAY,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.",FEMALE
840,TONY STARK,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.",MALE
841,FRIDAY,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.",FEMALE
842,STEVE ROGERS,"The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?",MALE
843,TONY STARK,"Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.",MALE
844,STEVE ROGERS,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.",MALE
845,TONY STARK,Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.,MALE
846,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...",FEMALE
847,STEVE ROGERS,Not 'til everyone's safe.,MALE
848,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.,FEMALE
849,STEVE ROGERS,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.,MALE
850,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't say we should leave.  There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?,FEMALE
851,NICK FURY,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better.   Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.",MALE
852,STEVE ROGERS,"Fury, you son of a bitch.",MALE
853,NICK FURY,Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?,MALE
854,MARIA HILL,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.,FEMALE
855,SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out.",MALE
856,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,This is SHIELD?,MALE
857,STEVE ROGERS,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.,MALE
858,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,This is not so bad.,MALE
859,STEVE ROGERS,Let's load 'em up.,MALE
860,MARIA HILL,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.",FEMALE
861,NICK FURY,Show 'em what we got.,MALE
862,MARIA HILL,You're up.,FEMALE
863,JAMES RHODES,Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.,MALE
864,TONY STARK,Yep. If you live to tell it.,MALE
865,JAMES RHODES,You think I can't hold my own?,MALE
866,TONY STARK,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.",MALE
867,JAMES RHODES,You had to make it weird.,MALE
868,CLINT BARTON,"Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!",MALE
869,SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.",MALE
870,MARIA HILL,Incoming!,FEMALE
871,SPECIALIST CAMERON KLEIN,"Oh, God!",MALE
872,ULTRON,You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.,MALE
873,THOR,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready?",MALE
874,VISION,It's terribly well balanced.,MALE
875,THOR,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.",MALE
876,TONY STARK,I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.,MALE
877,FRIDAY,Running numbers.  A heat seal could work with enough power.,FEMALE
878,TONY STARK,"Thor, I got a plan!",MALE
879,THOR,We're out of time. They're coming for the core.,MALE
880,TONY STARK,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.",MALE
881,JAMES RHODES,On it.,MALE
882,TONY STARK,"Avengers, time to work for a living.",MALE
883,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,You good?,MALE
884,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
885,TONY STARK,"Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini.""",MALE
886,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly.  What's the drill?",FEMALE
887,TONY STARK,"This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.",MALE
888,THOR,Is that the best you can do?,MALE
889,STEVE ROGERS,You had to ask.,MALE
890,ULTRON,"This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?",MALE
891,TONY STARK,"Well, like the old man said. Together.",MALE
892,ULTRON,"You know, with the benefit of hindsight....",MALE
893,THOR,They'll try to leave the city.,MALE
894,TONY STARK,"We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!",MALE
895,JAMES RHODES,"I'm on it.  Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ...  Okay, what?",MALE
896,STEVE ROGERS,"We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.",MALE
897,CLINT BARTON,What about the core?,MALE
898,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I'll protect it. It's my job.,FEMALE
899,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Get the people on the boats.,FEMALE
900,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,I'm not going to leave you here.,MALE
901,WANDA MAXIMOFF,"I can handle this.  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.",FEMALE
902,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,Hmm.,MALE
903,WANDA MAXIMOFF,You understand?,FEMALE
904,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you.",MALE
905,WANDA MAXIMOFF,Go.,FEMALE
906,FRIDAY,"Boss, power levels are way below opt...",FEMALE
907,TONY STARK,Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.,MALE
908,CLINT BARTON,"I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?",MALE
909,NATASHA ROMANOFF,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.,FEMALE
910,CLINT BARTON,No one eats in a dining room.  We don't have a lot of time.,MALE
911,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So get your ass on a boat.  Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low.",FEMALE
912,ZRINKA,Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!,FEMALE
913,TONY STARK,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.",MALE
914,THOR,Is this the last of them?,MALE
915,STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.,MALE
916,TONY STARK,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.",MALE
917,THOR,Maybe not.,MALE
918,ULTRON,"I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone.",MALE
919,PIETRO MAXIMOFF,You didn't see that coming.,MALE
920,ULTRON,"Oh, for God's sake!",MALE
921,CLINT BARTON,"No, no. I'm fine.  Oh, it's been a long day.",MALE
922,ULTRON,"Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.",MALE
923,WANDA MAXIMOFF,I just did. Do you know how it felt?  It felt like that.,FEMALE
924,TONY STARK,"Thor, on my mark.  Now!",MALE
925,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t...",FEMALE
926,VISION,You're afraid.,MALE
927,ULTRON,Of you?,MALE
928,VISION,Of death. You're the last one.,MALE
929,ULTRON,"You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.",MALE
930,VISION,I suppose we're both disappointments.,MALE
931,ULTRON,I suppose we are.,MALE
932,VISION,"Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.",MALE
933,ULTRON,They're doomed.,MALE
934,VISION,Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.,MALE
935,ULTRON,You're unbearably naive.,MALE
936,VISION,"Well, I was born yesterday.",MALE
937,LAURA BARTON,Say hi to Auntie Nat.,FEMALE
938,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fat.,FEMALE
939,NICK FURY,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.",MALE
940,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Right.,FEMALE
941,NICK FURY,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.,MALE
942,NATASHA ROMANOFF,"""Wish you were here."" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?",FEMALE
943,NICK FURY,You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.,MALE
944,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Nothing lasts forever.,FEMALE
945,NICK FURY,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.",MALE
946,STEVE ROGERS,The rules have changed.,MALE
947,TONY STARK,We're dealing with something new.,MALE
948,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.",MALE
949,TONY STARK,A machine.,MALE
950,STEVE ROGERS,So it doesn't count.,MALE
951,TONY STARK,No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.,MALE
952,STEVE ROGERS,Right. Different rules for us.,MALE
953,TONY STARK,"Nice guy, but artificial.",MALE
954,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you.,MALE
955,THOR,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.",MALE
956,STEVE ROGERS,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...,MALE
957,TONY STARK,It would still go up.,MALE
958,STEVE ROGERS,Elevator's not worthy.,MALE
959,THOR,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.,MALE
960,TONY STARK,"Well, not if you don't leave.",MALE
961,THOR,I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...,MALE
962,TONY STARK,Triple Yahtzee?,MALE
963,STEVE ROGERS,You think you can find out what's coming?,MALE
964,THOR,"I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.",MALE
965,TONY STARK,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.,MALE
966,STEVE ROGERS,"I will miss you, Tony.",MALE
967,TONY STARK,"Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.",MALE
968,STEVE ROGERS,The simple life.,MALE
969,TONY STARK,You'll get there one day.,MALE
970,STEVE ROGERS,"I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out.",MALE
971,TONY STARK,You alright?,MALE
972,STEVE ROGERS,"I'm home.  You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.",MALE
973,NATASHA ROMANOFF,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?,FEMALE
974,STEVE ROGERS,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.",MALE
975,NATASHA ROMANOFF,We've got some hitters.,FEMALE
976,STEVE ROGERS,They're good. They're not a team.,MALE
977,NATASHA ROMANOFF,Let's beat 'em into shape.,FEMALE
978,STEVE ROGERS,Avengers...!,MALE
979,THANOS,"Fine, I'll do it myself.",MALE
