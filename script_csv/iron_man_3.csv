251,TONY STARK,"Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.",MALE

260,TONY STARK,Relax.,MALE
261,HAPPY HOGAN,Seriously?,MALE
262,TONY STARK,I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?,MALE

264,TONY STARK,A giant brain?,MALE
265,HAPPY HOGAN,"Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.",MALE
266,TONY STARK,"I miss you, Happy.",MALE
267,HAPPY HOGAN,"Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...",MALE

270,TONY STARK,"I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.",MALE
271,HAPPY HOGAN,"Yeah, nice.",MALE
272,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.,MALE
273,PEPPER POTTS,It would be incredible.,FEMALE
274,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Mm.,MALE
275,PEPPER POTTS,"Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...",FEMALE
276,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.",MALE
277,PEPPER POTTS,"It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.",FEMALE
278,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'",MALE
279,PEPPER POTTS,That's very deep.,FEMALE
280,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Mm,MALE
281,PEPPER POTTS,And I have no idea what it means.,FEMALE
282,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.",MALE

615,TONY STARK,"You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?",MALE
616,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?",MALE
617,TONY STARK,"It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?",MALE
618,JAMES RHODES,"A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?",MALE
619,TONY STARK,"Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?",MALE
620,JAMES RHODES,Yeah.,MALE
621,TONY STARK,"I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.",MALE
622,JAMES RHODES,"It's the same as it's always been, ""WarMachine68.""",MALE
623,TONY STARK,"And password, please.",MALE
624,JAMES RHODES,"Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.",MALE
625,TONY STARK,"It's not the '80s, nobody says ""hack"" any more. Give me your login.",MALE
626,JAMES RHODES,"""WAR MACHINE ROX"" with an ""X,"" all caps.",MALE
627,TONY STARK,"That is so much better than ""lron Patriot.""",MALE
628,EMCEE,Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?,MALE
629,ELK RIDGE,"Well, David...",FEMALE
630,CREW,Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...,NEUTRAL
631,EMCEE,"One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.",MALE
632,CAMERAMAN,Because you erase my shows!,MALE
633,TONY STARK,That ain't gonna cut it.,MALE
634,CAMERAMAN,"We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...",MALE
635,TONY STARK,Shh.,MALE
636,CAMERAMAN,"Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.",MALE
637,TONY STARK,Shh. Keep it down.,MALE
638,CAMERAMAN,Tony Stark is in my van!,MALE
639,TONY STARK,"No, he's not.",MALE
640,CAMERAMAN,I knew you were still alive!,MALE
641,TONY STARK,Come on in. Close the door. Shh...,MALE
642,CAMERAMAN,"Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...",MALE
643,TONY STARK,Yep.,MALE
644,CAMERAMAN,I am your biggest fan.,MALE
645,TONY STARK,"Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?",MALE
646,CAMERAMAN,"No, no, no. Just us.",MALE
647,TONY STARK,Great. What's your name?,MALE
648,CAMERAMAN,Gary,MALE
649,TONY STARK,Gary?,MALE
650,GARY,"Oh, wow.",MALE
651,TONY STARK,Right there is fine.,MALE
652,GARY,Okay.,MALE
653,TONY STARK,"Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.",MALE
654,GARY,"Oh, good. Can I just say?",MALE
655,TONY STARK,What do you want?,MALE
656,GARY,"Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...",MALE
657,TONY STARK,It's fine.,MALE
658,GARY,"It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.",MALE
659,TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
660,GARY,"I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!",MALE
661,TONY STARK,A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?,MALE
662,GARY,"Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...",MALE
663,TONY STARK,"Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.",MALE
664,GARY,Got it.,MALE
665,TONY STARK,All right? It's a mission.,MALE
666,GARY,Yeah.,MALE
667,TONY STARK,Tony needs Gary.,MALE
668,GARY,And Gary needs Tony.,MALE
669,TONY STARK,Be quiet about it. Go.,MALE
670,GARY,Yeah.,MALE
671,ALDRICH KILLIAN,What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?,MALE
672,CHAD DAVIS,"Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me.",MALE
673,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Will you please state your name for the camera?,MALE
674,BRANDT,Ellen Brandt.,MALE
675,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here!",MALE
676,TONY STARK,"A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to ALDRICH KILLIAN. Got you, pal.",MALE
677,MAYA HANSEN,"What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.",FEMALE
678,PEPPER POTTS,"You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.",FEMALE
679,MAYA HANSEN,"Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.",FEMALE
680,PEPPER POTTS,"That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.",FEMALE
681,MAYA HANSEN,"Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. ",FEMALE
682,PEPPER POTTS,"Maya, run!",FEMALE
683,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hi, Pepper. So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?",MALE
684,MAYA HANSEN,I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.,FEMALE
685,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?",MALE
686,MAYA HANSEN,"I've told you, Killian, we can use him.",FEMALE
687,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.,MALE
688,MAYA HANSEN,"Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.",FEMALE
689,MAN,This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.,MALE
690,JAMES RHODES,"Copy.  Nobody move.  Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless ALDRICH KILLIAN's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure.",MALE
691,WOMAN,Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.,FEMALE
692,JAMES RHODES,"If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.",MALE
693,WOMAN,"That's the plan, Colonel.",FEMALE
694,TONY STARK,"Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.",MALE
695,HARLEY KEENER,"Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?",FEMALE
696,TONY STARK,How much have you had?,MALE
697,HARLEY KEENER,Two or three bowls.,FEMALE
698,TONY STARK,Can you still see straight?,MALE
699,HARLEY KEENER,Sort of.,FEMALE
700,TONY STARK,"That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?",MALE
701,JARVIS,"It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint ALDRICH KILLIAN's broadcast signal.",MALE
702,TONY STARK,"What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?",MALE
703,JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it's in Miami.",MALE
704,TONY STARK,"Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.",MALE
705,HARLEY KEENER,"Um, it does say Miami, Florida.",FEMALE
706,TONY STARK,"Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?",MALE
707,HARLEY KEENER,"Uh, it's not charging.",FEMALE
708,JARVIS,"Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.",MALE
709,TONY STARK,"What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...  Oh, God, not again.",MALE
710,HARLEY KEENER,Tony?  Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.,FEMALE
711,TONY STARK,"Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.",MALE
712,HARLEY KEENER,"Okay, um, uh...",FEMALE
713,TONY STARK,"God, what am I gonna do?",MALE
714,HARLEY KEENER,"Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?",FEMALE
715,TONY STARK,Right.,MALE
716,HARLEY KEENER,You said so.,FEMALE
717,TONY STARK,"Yes, I did.",MALE
718,HARLEY KEENER,Why don't you just build something?,FEMALE
719,TONY STARK,"Okay. Thanks, kid.",MALE
720,WOMAN,Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.,FEMALE
721,MAN,"My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con...",MALE
722,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.  Now, which one of you is Vanessa?",MALE
723,VANESSA,That's me.,FEMALE
724,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?,MALE
725,VANESSA,There's some guy over here.,FEMALE
726,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.",MALE
727,TONY STARK,Hey!,MALE
728,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Bloody hell. Bloody hell.,MALE
729,TONY STARK,Don't move.,MALE
730,ALDRICH KILLIAN,I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.,MALE
731,TONY STARK,What?,MALE
732,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?",MALE
733,TONY STARK,"Heard enough. You're not him. ALDRICH KILLIAN, the real guy. Where? Where's ALDRICH KILLIAN? Where is he?",MALE
734,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.",MALE
735,TONY STARK,What do you mean?,MALE
736,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.",MALE
737,TONY STARK,It is?,MALE
738,ALDRICH KILLIAN,It's complicated.,MALE
739,TONY STARK,"Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit.",MALE
740,ALDRICH KILLIAN,My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.,MALE
741,TONY STARK,"What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?",MALE
742,TREVOR SLATTERY,"What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.  Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.",FEMALE
743,TONY STARK,You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.,MALE
744,TREVOR SLATTERY,"It's just a role. ""ALDRICH KILLIAN,"" see, it's not real.",FEMALE
745,TONY STARK,"Then how did you get here, Trevor?",MALE
746,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.",FEMALE
747,TONY STARK,Next?,MALE
748,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.",FEMALE
749,TONY STARK,What did they say? They'd get you off them?,MALE
750,TREVOR SLATTERY,They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.,FEMALE
751,TONY STARK,Did you just nod off? Hey.,MALE
752,TREVOR SLATTERY,"No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions.",FEMALE
753,TONY STARK,"""He""? Killian?",MALE
754,TREVOR SLATTERY,Killian.,FEMALE
755,TONY STARK,He created you?,MALE
756,TREVOR SLATTERY,He created me.,FEMALE
757,TONY STARK,Custom-made terror threat.,MALE
758,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Westerngraphy. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought ALDRICH KILLIAN to life.",FEMALE
759,TONY STARK,Your performance? Where people died?,MALE
760,TREVOR SLATTERY,"No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.",FEMALE
761,TONY STARK,"I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under...",MALE
762,SAVIN,"Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?",MALE
763,TREVOR SLATTERY,I didn't tell him anything.,FEMALE
764,SAVIN,Nothing?,MALE
765,TREVOR SLATTERY,No.,FEMALE
766,SAVIN,You should have pressed the panic button.,MALE
767,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.",FEMALE
768,TONY STARK,Ah...  Okay.,MALE
769,MAYA HANSEN,"It's just like old times, huh?",FEMALE
770,TONY STARK,"Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.",MALE
771,MAYA HANSEN,It wasn't my idea.,FEMALE
772,TONY STARK,Okay. So you took Killian's card.,MALE
773,MAYA HANSEN,I took his money.,FEMALE
774,TONY STARK,"And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.",MALE
775,MAYA HANSEN,No.,FEMALE
776,TONY STARK,Yeah.,MALE
777,MAYA HANSEN,"No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.",FEMALE
778,TONY STARK,Yeah?,MALE
779,MAYA HANSEN,"A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.",FEMALE
780,TONY STARK,"I'm telling you it isn't.  I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.",MALE
781,MAYA HANSEN,Then help me fix it.,FEMALE
782,TONY STARK,Did I do that?,MALE
783,MAYA HANSEN,Yes.,FEMALE
784,TONY STARK,"I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?",MALE
785,MAYA HANSEN,You don't remember?,FEMALE
786,TONY STARK,I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.,MALE
787,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.""",MALE
788,TONY STARK,"You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?",MALE
789,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.",MALE
790,TONY STARK,"Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.",MALE
791,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.",MALE
792,TONY STARK,You're something else.,MALE
793,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You have met him, I assume?",MALE
794,TONY STARK,Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.,MALE
795,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.",MALE
796,TONY STARK,What's next for you in your world?,MALE
797,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.  Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?",MALE
798,MAYA HANSEN,Let him go.,FEMALE
799,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Hold on, hold on. Maya...",MALE
800,MAYA HANSEN,"I said, let him go.",FEMALE
801,ALDRICH KILLIAN,What are you doing?,MALE
802,MAYA HANSEN,"1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.",FEMALE
803,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.",MALE
804,MAYA HANSEN,"If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?",FEMALE
805,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"We're not doing this, okay?",MALE
806,MAYA HANSEN,What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?,FEMALE
807,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.",MALE
808,TONY STARK,You are a maniac.,MALE
809,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight.  Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.",MALE
810,SAVIN,"Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.",MALE
811,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Afternoon, gentlemen.  Hello, Colonel. Step aside.  Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.",MALE
812,SAVIN,You'll damage the armour.,MALE
813,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.",MALE
814,SAVIN,She's still in Phase Two.,MALE
815,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"You're not going deaf, are you?",MALE
816,TONY STARK,"Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?",MALE
817,GUARD,832 miles.,MALE
818,TONY STARK,Very nice.,MALE
819,GUARD,"I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?",MALE
820,TONY STARK,"Break it, you bought it.",MALE
821,GUARD,I think I bought it.,MALE
822,TONY STARK,"Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.",MALE
823,GUARD,What are you gonna do to me?,MALE
824,TONY STARK,You'll see.,MALE
825,GUARD,You're zip-tied to a bed. This.  That.,MALE
826,ALDRICH KILLIAN,Are you coming out?,MALE
827,JAMES RHODES,Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.  All right. Let's go.  You... You breathe fire? Okay.,MALE
828,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.",MALE
829,TONY STARK,"Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...",MALE
830,GUARD,How did we get this shift?,MALE
831,TONY STARK,"All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!",MALE
832,GUARD,Wow. That was...,MALE
833,TONY STARK,You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.,MALE
834,GUARD,I am just beyond terrified.,MALE
835,TONY STARK,"Here it comes. Three, four...",MALE
836,GUARD,Shut up.,MALE
837,TONY STARK,"Five, four, three, two, one!  Told you. Where's the rest?  Where's the rest?",MALE
838,MAN,"Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.",MALE
839,TONY STARK,"Ah! Better late than never.  Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.",MALE
840,JARVIS,"Oh, hello, sir.",MALE
841,GUARD,"All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.",MALE
842,TONY STARK,"Ah! Let's go!  Aw, crap.",MALE
843,JAMES RHODES,Tony?,MALE
844,TONY STARK,"JAMES RHODES, tell me that was you in the suit.",MALE
845,JAMES RHODES,No. You got yours'?,MALE
846,TONY STARK,"Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.",MALE
847,JAMES RHODES,"You, you, you! Move! Get out!",MALE
848,TONY STARK,The room is secure. I have eyes on ALDRICH KILLIAN.,MALE
849,JAMES RHODES,What's this? I had winners.,MALE
850,TONY STARK,What have you come as?,MALE
851,JAMES RHODES,"You make a move, and I break your face.",MALE
852,TONY STARK,I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.,MALE
853,JAMES RHODES,This is ALDRICH KILLIAN?,MALE
854,TONY STARK,"Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.",MALE
855,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.",FEMALE
856,TONY STARK,"Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.",MALE
857,JAMES RHODES,You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.,MALE
858,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.",FEMALE
859,TONY STARK,Spill.,MALE
860,JAMES RHODES,Do you know what they did to my suit?,MALE
861,TONY STARK,What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.,MALE
862,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Woah!  Ole', ole', ole', ole'...",FEMALE
863,JAMES RHODES,"TONY STARK, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.",MALE
864,TONY STARK,"Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?",MALE
865,JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, a little bit.",MALE
866,TONY STARK,So?,MALE
867,JAMES RHODES,"What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.",MALE
868,TONY STARK,"Right.  Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a ""lovely speedboat""? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.",MALE
869,JAMES RHODES,"But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?",MALE
870,TONY STARK,Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.,MALE
871,VICE PRESIDENT,Thanks. Hello?,MALE
872,TONY STARK,"Sir, this is Tony Stark.",MALE
873,VICE PRESIDENT,Welcome back to the land of the living.,MALE
874,TONY STARK,We believe you're about to be drawn into ALDRICH KILLIAN campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.,MALE
875,VICE PRESIDENT,"Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.",MALE
876,JAMES RHODES,"Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.",MALE
877,VICE PRESIDENT,"Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.",MALE
878,JAMES RHODES,Rhodes and Stark out.,MALE
879,MAN,"Everything okay, sir?",MALE
880,VICE PRESIDENT,"Couldn't be better. I love you, babe.",MALE
881,PRESIDENT ELLIS,"Colonel Rhodes.  Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.",MALE
882,JAMES RHODES,"We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.",MALE
883,JARVIS,"Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.",MALE
884,TONY STARK,And what about the suit I'm wearing?,MALE
885,JARVIS,The armour is now at 92%.,MALE
886,TONY STARK,That's going to have to do.,MALE
887,MILITARY AIDE,"Everything all right, Colonel?",MALE

986,PEPPER POTTS,Tony.,FEMALE

1000,TONY STARK,"Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.  Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.",MALE
1001,ALDRICH KILLIAN,"No!  No more false faces. You said you wanted ALDRICH KILLIAN. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am ALDRICH KILLIAN!",MALE
1002,TONY STARK,"I got nothing.  Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?  Honey?",MALE
1003,PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, my God. That was really violent.",FEMALE
1004,TONY STARK,You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...,MALE
1005,PEPPER POTTS,I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?,FEMALE
1006,TONY STARK,It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.,MALE
1007,PEPPER POTTS,"You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?",FEMALE
1008,TONY STARK,"Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.",MALE

1011,PEPPER POTTS,"No, I'm gonna burn you.",FEMALE
1012,TONY STARK,"No, you're not. Not hot.",MALE
1013,PEPPER POTTS,Am I gonna be okay?,FEMALE
1014,TONY STARK,"No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.",MALE
1015,PEPPER POTTS,And all your distractions?,FEMALE
1016,TONY STARK,Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.,MALE
1017,JARVIS,"All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?",MALE
1018,TONY STARK,You know what to do.,MALE
1019,JARVIS,"The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?",MALE
1020,TONY STARK,"Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.  Okay, so far? Do you like it?",MALE
1021,PEPPER POTTS,It'll do.,FEMALE
1022,TONY STARK,"And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.",MALE
1023,TREVOR SLATTERY,"Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!",FEMALE
1024,TONY STARK,"But then I thought to myself, ""Why stop there?"" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you, that was the best sleep I'd had in years.",MALE
1025,NURSE,It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.,FEMALE
1026,HAPPY HOGAN,"No, look.",MALE
1027,TONY STARK,"So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man.  You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.",MALE
1028,TONY STARK,"To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.  And the fact that you've been able to -help me process...  Are you with me?",MALE
1029,BRUCE BANNER,"Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...",MALE
1030,TONY STARK,Are you actively napping?,MALE
1031,BRUCE BANNER,I was... I... I drifted.,MALE
1032,TONY STARK,Where did I lose you?,MALE
1033,BRUCE BANNER,Elevator in Switzerland.,MALE
1034,TONY STARK,"So, you heard none of it?",MALE
1035,BRUCE BANNER,I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.,MALE
1036,TONY STARK,So?,MALE
1037,BRUCE BANNER,I don't have the...,MALE
1038,TONY STARK,What? The time?,MALE
1039,BRUCE BANNER,Temperament.,MALE
1040,TONY STARK,"You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?",MALE
1041,BRUCE BANNER,Yes.,MALE
1042,TONY STARK,"I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.",MALE
