STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, it's an honor.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in.  That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, ""No, we'll negotiate."" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,So you gave him a promotion.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Am I supposed to know who that is?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry.  Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,He told me not to trust anyone.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ALEXANDER PIERCE,I wonder if that included him.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis.

DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accessing archive.  HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accidents will happen.  HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum.  As I was saying...",FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
STEVE ROGERS,What's on this drive?,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.,FEMALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it.
