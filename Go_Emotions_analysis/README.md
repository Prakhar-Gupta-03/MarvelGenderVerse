Method to reproduce results: 

1. Clone repository from GitHub (https://github.com/monologg/GoEmotions-pytorch).
2. Run goEmotionInference.ipynb to generate results
3. Run analysis.ipynb for generating plots and graphs.

Note: Since we cannot submit code written on an another repository, we have added our scripts on top of the repository's code for generating inferences.
