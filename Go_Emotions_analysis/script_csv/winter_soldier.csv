STEVE ROGERS,How many pirates?,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"Twenty-five, top mercs, led by this guy. Georges Batroc.",MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had thirty-six kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Hostages?,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"Uh...mostly techs. One officer, Jasper Sitwell.",MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,They're in the galley.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship? Alright, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you'll kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get 'em out. Let's move.",MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm multitasking.,FEMALE
FRENCH PIRATE #1,"I said to Batroc, if we want SHIELD to pay, we have to start sending them bodies now!  I have a bullet for someone.  You want a bullet in your head?! Do you want one? Eh? Move that leg. Want a bullet in your head?",MALE

NICK FURY,I'm not obliged to do anything.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Those hostages could've died, Nick.",MALE
NICK FURY,I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.",MALE
NICK FURY,"The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.,MALE
NICK FURY,It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,"You know, they used to play music.",MALE

NICK FURY,"He'd walk home every night, roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say ""hi"", people would say hi back. Time went on, neighborhood got rougher. He'd say ""Hi"", they'd say, ""Keep on steppin'. Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did he ever get mugged?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Every week some punk would say, ""What's in the bag?""",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What did he do?,MALE

NICK FURY,Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a .22.",MALE
NICK FURY,This is Project Insight. Three next generation Helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Launched from the Lemurian Star.,MALE
NICK FURY,Once we get them in the air they never need to come down. Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Stark?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Well, he had a few suggestions once he got an up close look at our old turbines. These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.,MALE
NICK FURY,We can't afford to wait that long.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Who's ""we""?",MALE
NICK FURY,"After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once we're way ahead of the curve.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.,MALE
NICK FURY,"You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.",MALE
NICK FURY,"SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.",MALE

PEGGY CARTER,"Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over a thousand men, including the man who would...who would become my husband as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Mm. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.,FEMALE
PEGGY CARTER,What is it?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders, serve. It's just not the same.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Hey. The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Peggy.,MALE

COUNCILWOMAN HAWLEY,"We don't need hearings, we need action. It's this Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.",FEMALE
COUNCILMAN YEN,A breach like this raises serious questions.,MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel in broad daylight?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"For the record, councilman, he's Algerian. I can draw a map if it'll help.",MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,"I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce. But this Council take things like international piracy fairly seriously.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Really? I don't. I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fall a rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee us.",MALE

NICK FURY,"It could be nothing, probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,What if it's something?,MALE
NICK FURY,Then we'll both be damn glad those Helicarriers aren't in the air.,MALE

BROCK RUMLOW,"Yeah.  STRIKE, move it out.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"For whatever it's worth, you did your best.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,"Thank you, sir.  Captain Rogers.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Neighbor.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, it's an honor.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in.  That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, ""No, we'll negotiate."" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,So you gave him a promotion.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don't know.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,You know it was bugged?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I did, because Nick told me.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?  I want you to see something.,MALE
SHIELD AGENT,"Who hired you, Batroc?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is that live?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Am I supposed to know who that is?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry.  Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He told me not to trust anyone.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,I wonder if that included him.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Captain.  Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.",MALE

STEVE ROGERS,It kind of feels personal.,MALE
25TH FLOOR STRIKE AGENT,Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air!,NEUTRAL
STRIKE AGENT,"Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go!",FEMALE
JASPER SITWELL,Are you kidding me?  He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge!,MALE
QUINJET PILOT,"Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.  Repeat, stand down.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"Eyes here.  Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,"With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.",FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Because he lied to us.  Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where is it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Safe.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Do better!,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where did you get it?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why would I tell you?,MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm not gonna ask you again.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,So he's a ghost story.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me.  Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.  Like you said, he's a ghost story.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.",MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.,MALE
COUNCILMAN SINGH,"Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.,MALE
COUNCILWOMAN HAWLEY,That discussion can be tabled for a later time.,FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,But you do want to have a discussion.,MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,"We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,How much time do we have?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Uh...about nine minutes from...  Now.  Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Can you override it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly.   I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.",FEMALE
APPLE EMPLOYEE,Can I help you guys with anything?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right! We're getting married.,MALE
APPLE EMPLOYEE,Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,New Jersey.,MALE
APPLE EMPLOYEE,Oh.  I have the exact same glasses.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Wow, you two are practically twins.",FEMALE
APPLE EMPLOYEE,"Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you.  You said nine minutes, come on.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Shh, relax. Got it.  You know it?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I used to. Let's go.  Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do it!,FEMALE
JACK ROLLINS,Negative at the source.,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Give me a floor rundown.,MALE
SHIELD AGENT #2,Negative on three.,FEMALE
SHIELD AGENT #3,Negative on two.,FEMALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"Snake the upper levels, work down to me.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Kiss me.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, they do.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You still uncomfortable?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's not exactly the word I would use.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Nazi Germany.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Mm.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Was that your first kiss since 1945?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"That bad, huh?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I didn't say that.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You don't need practice.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everybody needs practice.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Nobody special, though?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, that's alright, you just make something up.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"What, like you?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,That's a tough way to live.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"It's a good way not to die, though.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah. Who do you want me to be?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,How about a friend?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,This is it.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,The file came from these coordinates.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,So did I.  This camp is where I was trained.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Changed much?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,A little.,MALE
SERGEANT DUFFY,"Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it!  Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in!",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off.  What is it?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,This is SHIELD.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Maybe where it started.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,There's Stark's father.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Howard.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Who's the girl?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,If you're already working in a secret office...  Why do you need to hide the elevator?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient.",FEMALE
COMPUTER,Initiate system?,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Y-E-S, spells yes.  ""Shall we play a game?""  It's from a movie that...",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I saw it.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It's some kind of a recording.,FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Do you know this thing?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,How did you get here?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Invited.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.,FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,HYDRA died with the Red Skull.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Prove it.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accessing archive.  HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.",FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"Accidents will happen.  HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum.  As I was saying...",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What's on this drive?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.,FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,What kind of algorithm? What does it do?,FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who fired it?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,S.H.I.E.L.D.,FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time.",FEMALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Call in the asset.,MALE
RENATA,"I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?",FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.",MALE
RENATA,"Okay, night-night.",FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Good night.  Want some milk?  The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six.  They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours.",MALE
RENATA,"Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone.",FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, man.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Everyone we know is trying to kill us.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Not everyone.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You okay?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Yeah.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What's going on?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I owe you.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,It's okay.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I would now. And I'm always honest.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.",MALE
SAM WILSON,I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Pierce.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,So was Jasper Sitwell.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?",MALE
SAM WILSON,The answer is: you don't.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What's this?,MALE
SAM WILSON,Call it a resume.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you.  You didn't say he was a para-rescue.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is this Riley?,MALE
SAM WILSON,Yeah.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?",FEMALE
SAM WILSON,No. These.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I thought you said you were a pilot.,MALE
SAM WILSON,I never said pilot.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where can we get our hands on one of these things?,MALE
SAM WILSON,"The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Shouldn't be a problem.,MALE
STERN,"Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?",MALE
STERN,"Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.,MALE
STERN,"Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it.  This is a nice pin.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Thank you.,MALE
STERN,"Come here.  Hail, HYDRA.  See, it's right there...",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"I just saw that, yeah.",MALE
STERN,Should I get it checked?,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"I think you should.   I need a minute. Bring the car around.  Yes, sir?",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Who is this?,MALE
SAM WILSON,"The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock.  Your other ten o'clock.  There you go.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,What do you want?,MALE
SAM WILSON,"You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,And why would I do that?,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Tell me about Zola's algorithm.,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Never heard of it.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"I was throwing up, I get seasick.  Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You're right. It's not. It's hers.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Lillian. Lip piercing, right?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Yeah, she's cute.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I'm not ready for that.",MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What targets?,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The Future? How could it know?,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.  Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,And what then?,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What then?!,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,HYDRA doesn't like leaks.,MALE
SAM WILSON,So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.,MALE
JASPER SITWELL,"What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Shit!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Hang on!,MALE
BUCKY,She's mine.  Find him.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Go, I got this!",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened.  I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Get out of the way! Stay out of the way!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Bucky?,MALE
BUCKY,Who the hell is Bucky?,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down!  Get on your knees! Down!  Don't move.  Put the gun down. Not here. Not here!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.,MALE
SAM WILSON,How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"None of that's your fault, Steve.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.",MALE
SAM WILSON,We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.,MALE
MARIA HILL,Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.  Who's this guy?,FEMALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Three holes. Start digging.,MALE
MARIA HILL,GSW. She's lost at least a pint.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,Maybe two.,MALE
DOCTOR,Let me take her.,FEMALE
MARIA HILL,She'll want to see him first.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"About damn time.  Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.",MALE
DOCTOR,Don't forget your collapsed lung.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"They cut you open, your heart stopped.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?,MALE
MARIA HILL,Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,"Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Sergeant Barnes...,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Bucky, no!",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,The procedure has already started.  You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.  Put him on ice.,FEMALE
SCIENTIST #1,"Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Mission report.  Mission report, now.",MALE
BUCKY,The man on the bridge...  Who was he?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,You met him earlier this week on another assignment.,MALE
BUCKY,I knew him.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.",MALE
BUCKY,But I knew him.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Prep him.,MALE
SCIENTIST #1,He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Then wipe him and start over.,MALE
NICK FURY,"This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, ""Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility."" See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,We have to stop the launch.,FEMALE
NICK FURY,I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore.,MALE
SAM WILSON,What's that?,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,"We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.",MALE
NICK FURY,SHIELD had nothing to do with it.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.",MALE
NICK FURY,Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,And how many paid the price before you did?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Look, I didn't know about Barnes.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.",MALE
MARIA HILL,He's right.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.",MALE
NICK FURY,"Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.",MALE
BUCKY,We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.",MALE
BUCKY,How was it?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It was okay. She's next to Dad.,MALE
BUCKY,I was gonna ask...,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...",MALE
BUCKY,"We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash.  Come on.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.",MALE
BUCKY,"The thing is, you don't have to.  I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"He's gonna be there, you know?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don't know if I can do that.,MALE
SAM WILSON,"Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"He will. Gear up, it's time.",MALE
SAM WILSON,You gonna wear that?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform.",MALE
SMITHSONIAN GUARD,"Oh, man. I am so fired!",MALE
MAN ON PA,We are in final launch sequence.,MALE
SHIELD TECH,We are go on guidance.,MALE
WOMAN ON PA,All personnel to launch station.,FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,And how was your flight?,MALE
COUNCILMAN HAWLEY,Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.",MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,Including Captain America.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access.",MALE
COM TECH #1,I've been parking there for two months.,MALE
COM TECH #2,But it's his spot.,MALE
COM TECH #1,So where's he been?,MALE
COM TECH #2,I think Afghanistan.,MALE
COM TECH #1,"Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full.  Well, he could have said something.  Ow!",MALE
COM TECH #2,Must be the dish.,MALE
COM TECH #1,I'll check it out.,MALE
MAN ON PA,Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Excuse us.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head?",MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,You smug son of a bitch.,MALE
COUNCILMAN SINGH,Arrest him.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,I guess I've got the floor.,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now.  Is there a problem?,MALE
SHIELD TECH,I'm...,MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Is there a problem?,MALE
SHIELD TECH,"I'm sorry, sir.  I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders.",MALE
BROCK RUMLOW,Move away from your station.,MALE
SHARON CARTER,Like he said!  Captain's orders.,FEMALE
BROCK RUMLOW,"You picked the wrong side, Agent.",MALE
SHARON CARTER,Depends on where you're standing.,FEMALE
SHIELD AGENT,Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door!,MALE
MARIA HILL,They're initiating launch.,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"If they're shooting at you, they're bad.",MALE
SAM WILSON,"Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You okay?,MALE
SAM WILSON,I'm not dead yet.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution?  And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?",MALE
COUNCILMAN SINGH,Not if it was your switch.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?,FEMALE
CHARLIE WEAPONS TECH,Satellites in range at three thousand feet.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Falcon, status?",FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"Engaging.  Alright, Cap, I'm in.  Shit!",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Eight minutes, Cap.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Working on it.,MALE
COUNCILMAN ROCKWELL,What are you doing?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Including HYDRA's.,FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden.  Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Are you?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Alpha locked.,MALE
MARIA HILL,"Falcon, where are you now?",FEMALE
SAM WILSON,"I had to take a detour!  Oh, yeah!  I'm in. Bravo locked.",MALE
MARIA HILL,"Two down, one to go.",FEMALE
SHIELD PILOT,"All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.",MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Don't worry, company's coming.",FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Did you get my flowers?  I'm glad you're here, Nick.",MALE
NICK FURY,Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,You know how the game works.,MALE
NICK FURY,So why make me head of SHIELD?,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.,MALE
NICK FURY,I did what I did to protect people.,MALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,"Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.",MALE
NICK FURY,"No, I have the courage not to.",MALE
SHIELD COMPUTER,Retinal scanner active.,FEMALE
ALEXANDER PIERCE,You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?,MALE
NICK FURY,"I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary...  You need to keep both eyes open.",MALE
SHIELD COMPUTER,Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.,FEMALE
MARIA HILL,Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow.  Six minutes.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Roger! Let me know when you're ready.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I just did!,MALE
SAM WILSON,"You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I had a big breakfast.,MALE

COMMITTEE GENERAL,"Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.",FEMALE
COMMITTEE GENERAL,Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.,MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?,FEMALE

STEVE ROGERS,She's not a nurse.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,And you're not a SHIELD agent.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What was her name again?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Sharon. She's nice.  Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread.",FEMALE

There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.",MALE
LIST,What about the volunteers?,MALE
BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.,MALE
LIST,And the survivors?,MALE
BARON WOLFGANG VON STRUCKER,"The twins.  Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.",MALE
