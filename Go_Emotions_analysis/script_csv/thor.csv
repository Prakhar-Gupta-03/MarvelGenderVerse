JANE,Hurry!,FEMALE
JANE,Oh-- watch your head.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Thanks. So what's this ""anomaly"" of yours supposed to look like? ",FEMALE
JANE,"It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon-- ",FEMALE
SELVIG,"Racing Àúround Orion?"" I've always said you should have been a poet.",FEMALE
JANE,"Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you?",FEMALE
JANE,Not until you see it!,FEMALE
SELVIG,I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now.,FEMALE
JANE,Thank you.,FEMALE
SELVIG,For what?,FEMALE
JANE,The benefit of the doubt.,FEMALE
JANE,It's never taken this long before.,FEMALE
DARCY,Can I turn on the radio?,MALE
JANE,"Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the time.""",FEMALE
JANE,The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms.,FEMALE
JANE,The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand.,FEMALE
DARCY,Jane? ,MALE
JANE,There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction...,FEMALE
DARCY,I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment...,MALE
DARCY,Jane?,MALE
JANE,What?!,FEMALE
DARCY,I think you want to see this.,MALE
JANE,Holy. Shatner.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"That's your ""subtle"" aurora?! ",FEMALE
JANE,No-- yes! Let's go!,FEMALE
JANE,Isn't this great?!,FEMALE
JANE,"You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy? ",FEMALE
SELVIG,That's debateable. Put your seat belt on!,FEMALE
JANE,You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading.,FEMALE
DARCY,"Yeah, right! Good one! Oh God, you're serious... ",MALE
JANE,You want those college credits or not?,FEMALE
DARCY,Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King.,MALE
JANE,What are you doing?!,FEMALE
DARCY,Saving our lives!,MALE
DARCY,I think that was legally your fault.,MALE
JANE,Get the first aid kit.,FEMALE
JANE,"Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. ",FEMALE
DARCY,Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR.,MALE
JANE,HIS EYES--,FEMALE
DARCY,--are beautiful.,MALE
JANE,--are dilating. That's a good sign.,FEMALE
SELVIG,We still have to get him to a hospital.,FEMALE
JANE,After we get a reading on the storm?,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Immediately, Jane.",FEMALE
JANE,Where did he come from?,FEMALE
HEIMDALL,"Questions, they've always asked questions -- this race called man, on this planet they call earth. Passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens.",MALE
HEIMDALL,"In ages past, they looked to us as gods, for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity. We tried to show them how their world was but one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all others by the branches of Yggdrasil...",MALE
HEIMDALL,"...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in a universe of wonder, beauty, and terror that they barely comprehended.",MALE
HEIMDALL,"But for all their thirst for knowledge, they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams. Where did he come from? He came from us, the proudest race of warriors the Worlds have ever seen. He came from this -- the greatest Realm the universe has ever known.",MALE
HEIMDALL,He came... from Asgard!,MALE
ODIN,Do you think he's ready?,MALE
FRIGGA,He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.,MALE
ODIN,He'll need his father's wisdom.,MALE
FRIGGA,And his humility?,MALE
FRIGGA,Thor won't be alone. Loki will be at his side to give him counsel. Have faith in your sons.,MALE
ODIN,"Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King...",MALE
ODIN,...if we only had more time.,MALE
FRIGGA,"For once, our son needs something we cannot provide. ",MALE
ODIN,I can fight it a little longer...,MALE
FRIGGA,No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you.,MALE
ODIN,"I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me? ",MALE
FRIGGA,Always.,MALE
ODIN,Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king.,MALE
THOR,Another!,MALE
LOKI,"Nervous, brother? ",MALE
THOR,Have you ever known me to be nervous?,MALE
LOKI,There was the time in Nornheim...,MALE
THOR,"That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?",MALE
LOKI,"As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape. ",MALE
THOR,"Some do battle, others just do tricks.",MALE
THOR,Loki... ,MALE
THOR,Now that was just a waste of good wine.,MALE
LOKI,"Just a bit of fun. Right, my friend?",MALE
LOKI,Nice feathers.,MALE
THOR,"You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow? ",MALE
LOKI,I was being sincere!,MALE
THOR,You're incapable of sincerity.,MALE
LOKI,Am I?,MALE
LOKI,"I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.",MALE
THOR,Thank you.,MALE
LOKI,Give us a kiss.,MALE
THOR,Stop.,MALE
THOR,How do I look?,MALE
LOKI,Like a king.,MALE
LOKI,It's time.,MALE
THOR,You go ahead.,MALE
THOR,I'll be along. Go on.,MALE
FANDRAL,"Thank you, love. ",MALE
FANDRAL,Now who'd like to polish my sword for me?,MALE
SIF,I'll miss you.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished.,MALE
FANDRAL,Noooo!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be. ",MALE
FANDRAL,"My, we are hungry, aren't we?",MALE
FANDRAL,"Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one smile.",MALE
FANDRAL,"All right, half a smile. Look, forget the smile, just show some teeth. ",MALE
SIF,"Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge? ",FEMALE
FANDRAL,"Name it, Lady Sif. ",MALE
SIF,Keep your mouth shut.,FEMALE
FRIGGA,It's all right to be nervous.,MALE
THOR,Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!,MALE
FRIGGA,You may be able to fool the rest of ASGARD --,MALE
THOR,...but never you. I know.,MALE
FRIGGA,"Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had. ",MALE
THOR,And what is that?,MALE
FRIGGA,Me for a mother.,MALE
FRIGGA,Now don't keep your father waiting.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Where is he?,MALE
LOKI,He said he'd be along.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,What?,MALE
SIF,He wants to make an entrance.,FEMALE
FANDRAL,"Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother.",MALE
LOKI,I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.,MALE
SIF,"Oh, please.",FEMALE
ODIN,"Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born. ",MALE
ODIN,"So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.",MALE
ODIN,"Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King.",MALE
ODIN,"Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms? ",MALE
THOR,I swear.,MALE
ODIN,Do you swear to preserve the peace?,MALE
THOR,I swear.,MALE
ODIN,Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms?,MALE
THOR,I swear.,MALE
ODIN,"Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you--",MALE
ODIN,Frost giants...,MALE
SIF,The Destroyer.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,I thought it was but a legend.,MALE
FANDRAL,I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,The Tesseract? I thought that was but a legend too!,MALE
SIF,Shush!,FEMALE
THOR,The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!,MALE
ODIN,"They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe. All is well. ",MALE
THOR,All is well?! They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these RELICS--,MALE
ODIN,But they didn't.,MALE
THOR,I want to know why they--,MALE
ODIN,The Casket of Ancient Winters belonged to the Jotuns. They believe it's their birthright.,MALE
THOR,And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!,MALE
ODIN,"I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King. ",MALE
THOR,He just broke your truce! We must act!,MALE
ODIN,Leave us.,MALE
ODIN,And what action would you take?,MALE
THOR,"March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again! ",MALE
ODIN,You're thinking only as a warrior!,MALE
THOR,This was an act of war!,MALE
ODIN,"It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail. ",MALE
THOR,They got this far!,MALE
ODIN,"We will find the breach in our defenses. It will be found, and it will be sealed. ",MALE
THOR,"As King of Asgard, I would-- ",MALE
ODIN,You are not King. Not yet.,MALE
SIF,"Redecorating, are we?",FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,What's this -- ?!,MALE
HOGUN,I told you they'd cancel it.,MALE
FANDRAL,We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart!",MALE
THOR,"It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother. ",MALE
LOKI,Who said I was wise?,MALE
THOR,This was to be my day of triumph.,MALE
LOKI,"It will come. In time. If it's any consolation, I think you're right. About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, everything. If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once, who's to say they won't try again. Next time with an army? ",MALE
THOR,"Yes, exactly! ",MALE
LOKI,But there's nothing we can do without defying Father.,MALE
LOKI,No... stop there! I know that look!,MALE
THOR,It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.,MALE
LOKI,It's madness!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Madness? What sort of madness?,MALE
LOKI,Nothing! Thor was making a jest!,MALE
THOR,The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.,MALE
FANDRAL,What?!,MALE
SIF,"Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break.",FEMALE
FANDRAL,"This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim. ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will! ",MALE
THOR,"My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers. ",MALE
SIF,It is forbidden! ,FEMALE
THOR,"My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together?",MALE
THOR,Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?,MALE
FANDRAL,You did.,MALE
THOR,"Who led you into the most glorious of battles... ...and to delicacies so succulent, you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla? ",MALE
VOLSTAGG / HOGUN,You did.,MALE
THOR,And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?,MALE
SIF,I did.,FEMALE
THOR,"True. But I supported you... My friends, trust me now. We must do this.",MALE
THOR,"Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you?",MALE
LOKI,What?,MALE
THOR,You are coming with me...,MALE
LOKI,"Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side. ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,And I.,MALE
FANDRAL,And I.,MALE
HOGUN,And I. The Warriors Three fight together.,MALE
SIF,I fear we'll live to regret this.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,If we're lucky.,MALE
THOR,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.,MALE
FANDRAL,And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Jest not! He heareth all!,MALE
FANDRAL,"Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,Forgive him! He meaneth no offense!,MALE
LOKI,"Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me.",MALE
LOKI,GOOD HEIMDALL--,MALE
HEIMDALL,You're not dressed warmly enough.,MALE
LOKI,I'm sorry?,MALE
HEIMDALL,"The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor. You think you can deceive me? I, who watch all? I, who can sense the flapping of a butterfly's wings a thousand worlds away?",MALE
HEIMDALL,Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim?,MALE
FANDRAL,"That was just a bit of a jest, really...",MALE
LOKI,You must be mistaken. We're not--,MALE
THOR,"Enough. Heimdall, may we pass?",MALE
HEIMDALL,"For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened. ",MALE
THOR,Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?,MALE
LOKI,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth.,MALE
HEIMDALL,"Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim. ",MALE
THOR,I have no plans to die today.,MALE
HEIMDALL,None do.,MALE
HEIMDALL,All is ready. You may pass.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?,MALE
HEIMDALL,To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Ah. Never mind, then.",MALE
THOR,Come on. Don't be bashful.,MALE
THOR,"Come on, big fella. Up...!",MALE
VOLSTAGG,This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!,MALE
FANDRAL,You bathe?,MALE
HOGUN,We shouldn't be here.,MALE
THOR,Too late now.,MALE
FANDRAL,"Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice.",MALE
LOKI,Perhaps we should wait.,MALE
THOR,For what?,MALE
LOKI,To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part. ",MALE
THOR,We know all we must. It's time to act.,MALE
SIF,He's just got to swing his hammer...,FEMALE
THOR,"It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world? ",MALE
FANDRAL,Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?,MALE
THOR,What would you call it?,MALE
FANDRAL,Freezing.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Starving.,MALE
SIF,Whining.,FEMALE
THOR,How about a song to lift our spirits?,MALE
HOGUN,"No, not that! ",MALE
SIF,Please don't make us sing again!,FEMALE
FANDRAL,"If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword! ",MALE
SIF,"Well, now I'm on board.",FEMALE
SIF,Where are they?,FEMALE
THOR,Hiding. As cowards always do.,MALE
JOTUN,"What is your business here, Asgardian?",MALE
THOR,I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.,MALE
JOTUN,Then speak.,MALE
LAUFEY,"I am Laufey, King of this Realm. ",MALE
THOR,And I am--,MALE
LAUFEY,"We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world? ",MALE
THOR,I demand answers.,MALE
LAUFEY,"You ""demand?""",MALE
THOR,How did your people get into Asgard?,MALE
LAUFEY,The house of Odin is full of traitors.,MALE
THOR,Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.,MALE
LAUFEY,"Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket. ",MALE
THOR,Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms.,MALE
LAUFEY,"And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man. ",MALE
THOR,This boy has grown tired of your mockery.,MALE
LOKI,"Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered. ",MALE
THOR,"Know your place, brother... ",MALE
LAUFEY,You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash.,MALE
LAUFEY,"But I do. Go now, while I still allow it.",MALE
LOKI,We will accept your most gracious offer.,MALE
JOTUN,"Run back home, little princess.",MALE
LOKI,Damn.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own!,MALE
FANDRAL,I'm hoping that's just decorative.,MALE
THOR,Next!,MALE
FANDRAL,"Well? What move, do you think? ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge.""",MALE
FANDRAL,"At this close range? I think ""The Alfheim Lunge"" is a better move. ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Maybe if they were three feet tall! No! How about ""The Randy Valkyrie""?",MALE
HOGUN,Shut up!,MALE
SIF,"If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady!",FEMALE
LOKI,Pathetic.,MALE
THOR,Come on! At least make it a challenge for me!,MALE
THOR,Now that's more like it!,MALE
THOR,Ugly and stupid.,MALE
SIF,I'm so glad I taught him how to do that!,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,You may want to put some ice on that!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"You may be taller, but I'm wider!",MALE
VOLSTAGG,It's not too late for you to surrender.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Don't let them grab hold of you!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Thank you, my lady. But I nearly had him! ",MALE
SIF,Of course you did.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,Hang on!,MALE
HOGUN,Watch the legs!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Right. Sorry.,MALE
FANDRAL,You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel?,MALE
FANDRAL,Fair enough.,MALE
FANDRAL,Could we stop just a moment while I get another sword?,MALE
VOLSTAGG,That's unfortunate.,MALE
FANDRAL,"I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it? ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,Just try not to bleed.,MALE
FANDRAL,How's the face?,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Flawless.,MALE
THOR,Come on!,MALE
LOKI,That can't be good.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Yes, it could! Might be an early spring!",MALE
LOKI,"Thor, we must go!",MALE
THOR,Then go!,MALE
SIF,There are too many of them!,FEMALE
THOR,I can stop them!,MALE
SIF,Thor!,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,Run!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,What's Thor done?,MALE
LOKI,Likely killed us all!,MALE
THOR,"Loki, we have to see.",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Actually, could you bring the mists back, please?",MALE
ODIN,Laufey. End this.,MALE
LAUFEY,Your boy sought this out.,MALE
ODIN,You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed.,MALE
LAUFEY,"We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death.",MALE
ODIN,So be it.,MALE
THOR,Now! We'll finish them together!,MALE
ODIN,Silence!,MALE
THOR,Why did you bring us back?,MALE
ODIN,Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?,MALE
THOR,I was protecting my home.,MALE
ODIN,You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom?,MALE
ODIN,Get him to the healing room!,MALE
THOR,There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act!,MALE
THOR,"Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt. ",MALE
ODIN,"That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning? ",MALE
THOR,"While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls! ",MALE
ODIN,"You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy! ",MALE
THOR,And you are an old man and a fool!,MALE
ODIN,"A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready.",MALE
LOKI,FATHER--,MALE
ODIN,"Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war.",MALE
ODIN,You are unworthy of this Realm...,MALE
ODIN,...unworthy of your title...,MALE
ODIN,...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers.,MALE
ODIN,In the name of my father...,MALE
ODIN,...and of his father before...,MALE
ODIN,I cast you out!,MALE
ODIN,"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.",MALE
DARCY,I think that was legally your fault.,MALE
JANE,"Get the first aid kit. Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me.",FEMALE
DARCY,Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR.,MALE
JANE,Where did he come from?,FEMALE
JANE,"Uh, thanks. Are you okay?",FEMALE
THOR,Hammer...,MALE
DARCY,"Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious.",MALE
JANE,Erik... look at this.,FEMALE
JANE,We've got to move fast before anything changes.,FEMALE
JANE,"We need soil samples, light readings, everything.",FEMALE
SELVIG,"Jane, we need get him to a hospital.",FEMALE
JANE,Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here.,FEMALE
JANE,"Look at him, he's fine.",FEMALE
THOR,Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!,MALE
JANE,"Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here. ",FEMALE
SELVIG,You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert?,FEMALE
THOR,You! What world is this?,MALE
SELVIG,"It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help.",FEMALE
THOR,Where am I?! Answer me!,MALE
JANE,"Erik, just back away... ",FEMALE
SELVIG,You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.,FEMALE
THOR,What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?,MALE
DARCY,Uh... New Mexico?,MALE
THOR,You dare threaten Thor with so puny A--,MALE
DARCY,What? He was freaking me out.,MALE
SELVIG,"Next time you decide to taser someone, do me a favor and make sure they're already inside the truck. Jane, come on...",FEMALE
NURSE,Name?,FEMALE
JANE,"He said it was ""Thor."" ",FEMALE
NURSE,T-H-O-R. And your relationship to him?,FEMALE
JANE,I've never met him before.,FEMALE
DARCY,Until she hit him with the car.,MALE
JANE,"Grazed him, actually. Oh, and we tasered him, too. ",FEMALE
NURSE,Must have been quite the spat.,FEMALE
JANE,"I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay. ",FEMALE
NURSE,I'm going to need a name and contact number.,FEMALE
JANE,Jane Foster.,FEMALE
NURSE,J...A...N...,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Oh, for God's sake...",FEMALE
SELVIG,Here. Let's go.,FEMALE
NURSE,Hi. Just taking a little blood.,FEMALE
THOR,How dare you attack the son of Odin!,MALE
NURSE,I need some help!,FEMALE
NURSE,We're trying to help you!,FEMALE
THOR,"Then bring me a healing stone, you savages!",MALE
ORDERLY,What the hell is this guy on?,MALE
THOR,You're no match for the Mighty--,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,Huh.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,Huh.,MALE
JANE,"Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me. ",FEMALE
SELVIG,We might want to perform a spectral analysis.,FEMALE
JANE,"""We?""",FEMALE
SELVIG,I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful.,FEMALE
JANE,You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?,FEMALE
SELVIG,She was more than a friend.,FEMALE
JANE,Could you call in a favor?,FEMALE
SELVIG,You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?,FEMALE
JANE,"If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event. ",FEMALE
SELVIG,Meaning?,FEMALE
JANE,Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"How ""big"" are we talking about?",FEMALE
JANE,I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.,FEMALE
DARCY,A what?,MALE
SELVIG,I thought you were a science major.,FEMALE
DARCY,Political Science.,MALE
JANE,She was the only applicant.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a ""theoretical"" connection between two different points of space-time.",FEMALE
JANE,A wormhole.,FEMALE
JANE,"Erik, look...",FEMALE
JANE,What do you see here?,FEMALE
SELVIG,Stars.,FEMALE
JANE,Yes. But not our stars.,FEMALE
JANE,"This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations.",FEMALE
DARCY,"Hey, check it out.",MALE
SELVIG,Is that...?,FEMALE
JANE,I think I left something at the hospital.,FEMALE
FRIGGA,How could you have done this?,MALE
ODIN,Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!,MALE
FRIGGA,But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!,MALE
ODIN,What would you have done?,MALE
FRIGGA,"I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty! ",MALE
ODIN,"That is why I'm King. I, too, grieve the loss of our son. But there are some things that even I cannot undo. ",MALE
FRIGGA,You can bring him back.,MALE
ODIN,No. His fate is in his own hands now.,MALE
THOR,It's not possible.,MALE
NURSE,"I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients. ",FEMALE
JANE,But... I'm his wife.,FEMALE
NURSE,I thought you said you didn't know him.,FEMALE
JANE,"I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway? ",FEMALE
NURSE,"None of us, dear. He's in Room",FEMALE
JANE,Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.,FEMALE
DARCY,So now what?,MALE
JANE,We find him.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.,FEMALE
JANE,"I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice. ",FEMALE
DARCY,Oo-kay.,MALE
SELVIG,So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?,FEMALE
JANE,However long it takes.,FEMALE
JANE,I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.,FEMALE
THOR,"Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it? ",MALE
DARCY,I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.,MALE
JANE,Let's get you some clothes.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,We should never have let him go.,MALE
SIF,There was no stopping him.,FEMALE
FANDRAL,"At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone. ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,How did the guard even know?,MALE
LOKI,I told him.,MALE
FANDRAL,What?,MALE
LOKI,I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,You told the guard?,MALE
LOKI,I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.,MALE
SIF,"Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind! ",FEMALE
LOKI,"And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King?",MALE
SIF,"He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor. ",FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,"True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives. ",MALE
HOGUN,Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin.,MALE
FANDRAL,"Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous? ",MALE
HOGUN,A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,No! Surely not!,MALE
FANDRAL,"Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely. ",MALE
SIF,Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.,MALE
SIF,We should go to the Allfather.,FEMALE
FANDRAL,"And tell him what? ""Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!""",MALE
SIF,"It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.",FEMALE
ODIN,Stop!,MALE
LOKI,Am I cursed?,MALE
ODIN,No. Put the Casket down.,MALE
LOKI,What am I?,MALE
ODIN,You're my son.,MALE
LOKI,What more than that?,MALE
LOKI,"The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?",MALE
ODIN,"No. In the aftermath of the battle, I went into the Temple, and I found a baby. Small for a giant's offspring -- abandoned, suffering, left to die. Laufey's son.",MALE
LOKI,Laufey's son...,MALE
LOKI,Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?,MALE
ODIN,You were an innocent child.,MALE
LOKI,"You took me for a purpose, what was it?",MALE
LOKI,Tell me!,MALE
ODIN,"I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter. ",MALE
LOKI,"So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me. ",MALE
ODIN,Why do you twist my words?,MALE
LOKI,You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?,MALE
ODIN,You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.,MALE
LOKI,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?,MALE
ODIN,Don't...,MALE
LOKI,It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.,MALE
ODIN,Listen...,MALE
LOKI,"Because no matter how much you claim to ""love"" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard!",MALE
ODIN,Listen to me!,MALE
ODIN,Loki!,MALE
LOKI,Guards!,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,This'll do it.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,"Okay, let 'er rip!",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Sir -- we've found it.,MALE
DARCY,"You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut.",MALE
DARCY,"Hey, sorry I tased you!",MALE
JANE,Excuse me... excuse me!,FEMALE
JANE,My ex.,FEMALE
JANE,They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.,FEMALE
THOR,They will suffice.,MALE
JANE,You're welcome. Now tell me...,FEMALE
JANE,"What were you doing, in that?",FEMALE
THOR,What does anyone do in the Bifrost?,MALE
SELVIG,The Bifrost...,FEMALE
JANE,What exactly is the Bifrost?,FEMALE
THOR,This mortal form has grown weak.,MALE
JANE,BUT--,FEMALE
JANE,Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.,FEMALE
FRIGGA,I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.,MALE
LOKI,So why did he lie?,MALE
FRIGGA,"He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that.",MALE
FRIGGA,"You can speak to him. He can see and hear us, even now. ",MALE
LOKI,How long will it last?,MALE
FRIGGA,I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.,MALE
LOKI,I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.,MALE
FRIGGA,"But he's put it off for so long now, I fear...",MALE
FRIGGA,You're a good son.,MALE
FRIGGA,We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us. And your brother.,MALE
LOKI,What hope is there for Thor?,MALE
FRIGGA,There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home.,MALE
FRIGGA,"Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.",MALE
FRIGGA,Make your father proud.,MALE
JANE,Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night.,FEMALE
JANE,Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.,FEMALE
DARCY,And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry.,MALE
THOR,This drink. I like it.,MALE
DARCY,"Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town.",MALE
THOR,Another!,MALE
JANE,"Sorry, Izzy. Little accident. I'm going to pay for the cup.",FEMALE
ISABELA,"Did you see that? The first time she brings a man in here, and he's a lunatic! ",FEMALE
JANE,What was that?,FEMALE
THOR,It was delicious. I want another.,MALE
JANE,Then you should just say so!,FEMALE
THOR,I just did.,MALE
JANE,I mean ask for it. Nicely.,FEMALE
THOR,I meant no disrespect.,MALE
JANE,"All right, then no more smashing, deal? ",FEMALE
THOR,You have my word.,MALE
JANE,Good. ,FEMALE
ISABELA,"Morning, Pete. Jake. ",FEMALE
TOWNIE PETE,"The usual, please, Izzy.",MALE
TOWNIE PETE,You missed all the excitement out at the crater.,MALE
ISABELA,What crater?,FEMALE
TOWNIE PETE,They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,"We were having a good time with it till the Feds showed up, chased us out. ",MALE
JANE,"Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash? ",FEMALE
TOWNIE PETE,Yep. They said it was radioactive. And I had my hands all over it. I'm probably sterile now.,MALE
DARCY,"Oh my God, this is going on Facebook.",MALE
DARCY,Smile!,MALE
SELVIG,What did the satellite look like?,FEMALE
TOWNIE PETE,I don't know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.,MALE
THOR,Where?!,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,About twelve miles east of here.,MALE
PETE,I wouldn't bother! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!,MALE
JANE,Where are you going?,FEMALE
THOR,Twelve miles east of here.,MALE
JANE,Why?,FEMALE
THOR,To get what belongs to me.,MALE
JANE,So now you own a satellite?,FEMALE
THOR,It's not what they say it is.,MALE
JANE,"Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it? ",FEMALE
THOR,Yes.,MALE
THOR,"If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know. ",MALE
JANE,Everything?,FEMALE
THOR,"All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.",MALE
DARCY,"""Myeu-muh?"" What's ""Myeu-muh?""",MALE
SELVIG,Jane.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Please don't do this.,FEMALE
JANE,You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.,FEMALE
SELVIG,I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.,FEMALE
JANE,He's promised us answers.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! ""Thor."" ""Bifrost."" Mjolnir. These are the stories I grew up with as a child! ",FEMALE
JANE,"I'd just be driving him out there, that's all. ",FEMALE
SELVIG,It's dangerous. He's dangerous.,FEMALE
JANE,I'm sorry. I can't take you.,FEMALE
THOR,I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye.,MALE
JANE,That's... thank you.,FEMALE
THOR,Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell.,MALE
SELVIG,Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do.,FEMALE
SIF,"Allfather, we must speak with you URGENTLY--",FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,What is this?,MALE
LOKI,My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.,MALE
FANDRAL,Where is Odin?,MALE
LOKI,Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.,MALE
SIF,We would speak with her.,FEMALE
LOKI,"She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your ""urgent"" matter to me, your King.",MALE
SIF,We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.,FEMALE
LOKI,My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times.,MALE
LOKI,"All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard. ",MALE
FANDRAL,Of course.,MALE
JANE,Hey! That's my stuff!,FEMALE
JANE,What the hell is going on here?!,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,"Ms. Foster, I'm Agent PHIL COULSON, with SHIELD.",MALE
JANE,"I don't care who you work for, you can't do this! ",FEMALE
SELVIG,Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.,FEMALE
JANE,Let it go?! This is my life!,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.,MALE
JANE,"By ""appropriate"" you mean ""steal""?",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,This should more than compensate you for your trouble.,MALE
JANE,I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Then I'm sure you can do it again.,MALE
JANE,And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,"We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.",MALE
JANE,So are we! We're on the verge of UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING extraordinary.,FEMALE
JANE,"Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me.",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Thank you for your cooperation.,MALE
JANE,"Years of research, gone. ",FEMALE
DARCY,They even took my iPod.,MALE
SELVIG,And your back-ups?,FEMALE
JANE,Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.,FEMALE
DARCY,"I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there. ",MALE
JANE,Will you please stop talking about your iPod?! Who are these people?,FEMALE
SELVIG,"No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again. ",FEMALE
JANE,I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help. ",FEMALE
DARCY,"They took your laptop, too.",MALE
SELVIG,I'll just be a minute.,FEMALE
THOR,I need a horse.,MALE
PET STORE CLERK,"Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just dogs, cats, birds. ",MALE
THOR,"Then give me one of those, large enough to ride.",MALE
JANE,You still want a lift?,FEMALE
LIBRARIAN,"""And though they're large, giants 
can be quiet. You have to listen 
carefully for the sound of their 
footsteps -- because they may be 
closer than you think.""",MALE
LIBRARIAN,"Joshua, come sit down. It's story time.",MALE
JANE,I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before?,FEMALE
THOR,Many times. You're brave to do it.,MALE
JANE,They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.,FEMALE
THOR,But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.,MALE
JANE,"""This Realm?"" Why do you talk like that?",FEMALE
THOR,You think me strange?,MALE
JANE,Yeah. Just a little.,FEMALE
THOR,Good strange or bad strange?,MALE
JANE,I'm not quite sure yet.,FEMALE
JANE,Sorry.,FEMALE
JANE,Who are you? Really?,FEMALE
THOR,You'll see soon enough.,MALE
JANE,You promised me answers.,FEMALE
THOR,What you seek -- it's a bridge.,MALE
JANE,A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?,FEMALE
THOR,More like a rainbow bridge.,MALE
JANE,"God, I hope you're not crazy.",FEMALE
JANE,"That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it.",FEMALE
THOR,You're going to need this.,MALE
JANE,Why?--,FEMALE
THOR,"Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.",MALE
THOR,Deal?,MALE
JANE,"No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out! ",FEMALE
THOR,No.,MALE
THOR,I'm going to fly out.,MALE
JANE,Wait...,FEMALE
TECHIE,Feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover.,MALE
TECHIE,"Tech's barely working as it is, with all the interference that thing's giving off.",MALE
TECHIE,"Hey, we've got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us, Southwest Airlines Flight 5434. ",MALE
SITWELL,"Reroute it, like all the others. ",MALE
TECHIE,Right. Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble?,MALE
TECHIE,It'd be a nice gesture.,MALE
TECHIE,"Hold a sec... we got something outside the fence, west side...",MALE
SITWELL,"DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.",MALE
AGENT JACKSON,Looks like we're good here. Must have been another coyote. ,MALE
AGENT DELANCEY,Jackson?,MALE
SITWELL,"DeLancey, Jackson -- report.",MALE
SHIELD AGENT,Agents down! We've got a perimeter breach!,MALE
SITWELL,Get Coulson.,MALE
SELVIG,You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message.,FEMALE
JANE,"Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.",FEMALE
JANE,"But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now!,MALE
PHIL COULSON,barton. Talk to me.,MALE
CLINT BARTON,"One shot, one kill, sir. Just give the word.",MALE
CLINT BARTON,"Hello, handsome.",MALE
THOR,You're big.,MALE
THOR,Fought bigger.,MALE
JANE,No...,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,barton...,MALE
PHIL COULSON,...hold your fire.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Ground units, move in. Show's over.",MALE
JANE,I can't just leave him there.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Why not?,FEMALE
JANE,You didn't see what happened.,FEMALE
DARCY,Hey! Myeu-muh!,MALE
JANE,Where did you find this?,FEMALE
SELVIG,In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was.,FEMALE
JANE,"Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities? ",FEMALE
SELVIG,"I was talking about science, not magic! ",FEMALE
JANE,Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Who wrote science fiction.,FEMALE
JANE,The precursor of science fact.,FEMALE
SELVIG,In some cases.,FEMALE
JANE,"If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side. ",FEMALE
JANE,Advanced beings could have come through it before.,FEMALE
SELVIG,Jane...,FEMALE
DARCY,A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.,MALE
JANE,Yes! Exactly! Thank you!,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time. ",FEMALE
DARCY,I'll help you.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful. The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals, and in my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training to do what you did to them. Would you like to tell me where you received your training?",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa?",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Certain groups pay well for a good mercenary. Especially HYDRA.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Who are you?,MALE
THOR,Just a man.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"One way or another, we find out what we want to know. We're good at that.",MALE
LOKI,I thought he'd never leave.,MALE
THOR,Loki? What are you doing here?,MALE
LOKI,I had to see you.,MALE
THOR,What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to FATHER--,MALE
LOKI,Father is dead.,MALE
THOR,What?,MALE
LOKI,"Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.",MALE
LOKI,"You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen. ",MALE
LOKI,"It was cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing you could never lift it.",MALE
LOKI,The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.,MALE
THOR,Can I come home?,MALE
LOKI,The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.,MALE
THOR,But couldn't we find a way to--,MALE
LOKI,Mother has forbidden your return.,MALE
LOKI,"This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry. ",MALE
THOR,"No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here. ",MALE
LOKI,Nothing could have stopped me.,MALE
LOKI,"Fare well, brother. ",MALE
THOR,Good-bye.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Good-bye? I just got back.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Now. Where did we leave off?,MALE
SITWELL,Sir... he's got a visitor.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"""Donald Blake?""",MALE
SELVIG,Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,"You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig. ",MALE
SELVIG,"Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest. ",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?,MALE
SELVIG,Certainly.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"You can understand how a man could go off like that. I mean, a big, faceless organization like yours, coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property... ...is how he described it. ",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security.,MALE
SELVIG,Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,It says here he's an M.D.,MALE
SELVIG,"He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really. If you would just release him to me, I promise to keep an eye on him.",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again.,MALE
SELVIG,Thank you.,FEMALE
SELVIG,"Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are!",FEMALE
SELVIG,"It's going to be all right, my friend. Come on, I'm taking you home.",FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Just keep him away from the bars.,MALE
SELVIG,I will!,FEMALE
THOR,Where are we going?,MALE
SELVIG,To get a drink.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Follow them.,MALE
LAUFEY,Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.,MALE
LOKI,I've come alone and unarmed.,MALE
LAUFEY,To what end?,MALE
LOKI,To make you another proposition.,MALE
LAUFEY,So you're the one who let us into Asgard.,MALE
LOKI,You're welcome.,MALE
LAUFEY,"My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver.",MALE
LOKI,You have no idea what I am.,MALE
LOKI,"Hello, Father.",MALE
LAUFEY,"Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are. ",MALE
LOKI,"No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me.",MALE
LAUFEY,Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.,MALE
LOKI,"I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket.",MALE
LAUFEY,Why would you do this?,MALE
LOKI,"When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could. ",MALE
LAUFEY,This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.,MALE
LOKI,"No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told.",MALE
LAUFEY,I accept.,MALE
LOKI,"What troubles you, Gatekeeper? ",MALE
HEIMDALL,"I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm. ",MALE
LOKI,Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.,MALE
HEIMDALL,Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.,MALE
LOKI,"You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you? ",MALE
HEIMDALL,No.,MALE
LOKI,And why is that?,MALE
HEIMDALL,"Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him. ",MALE
LOKI,Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes?,MALE
HEIMDALL,Yes.,MALE
LOKI,Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started.,MALE
SELVIG,"Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker. ",FEMALE
THOR,Thank you for what you've done.,MALE
SELVIG,Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.,FEMALE
THOR,Are you in love with her?,MALE
SELVIG,"Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened.",FEMALE
THOR,Neither did I.,MALE
SELVIG,"I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you. ",FEMALE
THOR,"I swear to you, I mean her no harm. ",MALE
SELVIG,"Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight.",FEMALE
THOR,I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong.,MALE
SELVIG,"It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions.",FEMALE
THOR,"For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. ",MALE
SELVIG,Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are.,FEMALE
TOWNIE PETE,"Hey, I know you, man...",MALE
TOWNIE PETE,You were in the diner with that hot girl.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me.,MALE
THOR,I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,"And you should shut the hell up, princess.",MALE
THOR,I will not fight him.,MALE
TOWNIE PETE,Then it'll be easy to kick your ass.,MALE
SELVIG,"Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads.",FEMALE
SELVIG,Another drink?,FEMALE
THOR/SELVIG,"""The mood is good, our hearts are 
full, there's magic in the air. /

indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a 
friend is fine indeed!""",MALE
JANE,Erik! Is he all right?,FEMALE
THOR,He's fine. Not injured at all.,MALE
THOR,"Sorry, my friend. ",MALE
JANE,What happened?,FEMALE
THOR,We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.,MALE
JANE,Put him on the bed.,FEMALE
SELVIG,I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder. But you ought to be.,FEMALE
THOR,These are your chambers?,MALE
JANE,"Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never...",FEMALE
JANE,Can we go outside?,FEMALE
JANE,"I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy. I come up here a lot, now that I think about it.",FEMALE
JANE,I'm glad you're safe.,FEMALE
THOR,You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.,MALE
JANE,"I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out.",FEMALE
JANE,I don't believe it...,FEMALE
THOR,It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.,MALE
JANE,"No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch...",FEMALE
THOR,What's wrong?,MALE
JANE,"SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day. ",FEMALE
THOR,You must do this. You must finish what you've started.,MALE
JANE,Why?,FEMALE
THOR,Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.,MALE
THOR,Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing.,MALE
JANE,What is it?,FEMALE
THOR,"This is how my father explained it to me... Your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, you see it every day, without realizing. Images glimpsed through - - what did you call it?... this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine Realms...",MALE
FANDRAL,"Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?!",MALE

SIF,"Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it! ",FEMALE
HOGUN,We must go. We must find Thor.,MALE
FANDRAL,"It's treason, Hogun. ",MALE

FANDRAL,"Yes, yes, we know! ",MALE
SIF,Thor would do the same for us.,FEMALE
EINHERJAR GUARD,Heimdall demands your presence.,MALE

VOLSTAGG,So you'll help us?,MALE
HEIMDALL,I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you.,MALE

VOLSTAGG,Now what do we do?,MALE
SIF,Look!,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,What the hell was that?,MALE
TECHIE,"I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Let's go take a look.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.,MALE
FANDRAL,The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.,MALE
SIF,Or we could just start there.,FEMALE

VOLSTAGG,"Is it just me, or does Earth look a little different to you? ",MALE
SIF,It has been a thousand years...,FEMALE

VOLSTAGG,Perhaps we should split up.,MALE
AGENT GARRETT,Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?,MALE
AGENT CALE,Call it in.,MALE

EINHERJAR GUARD,"My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing.",MALE
HEIMDALL,"Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard? ",MALE
LOKI,"You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King. And I say, for your act of treason, you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a citizen of Asgard. ",MALE
HEIMDALL,Then I need no longer obey you.,MALE
LOKI,Ensure my brother does not return.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Found you!,MALE
THOR,My friends!,MALE
SELVIG,I don't believe it...,FEMALE
DARCY,Who are they?,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte?",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Well, perhaps I've put on a little more muscle since I was here last. ",MALE
JANE,That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us!,MALE
THOR,"My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come. ",MALE
FANDRAL,We're here to take you home.,MALE
THOR,You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile.,MALE
SIF,Thor... your father still lives.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Get somebody from Linguistics out here.,MALE
DARCY,Was somebody else coming?,MALE
SHIELD AGENT,Is that one of Stark's?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything.,MALE

PHIL COULSON,Incoming!,MALE
THOR,Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.,MALE
JANE,What about you?,FEMALE
THOR,I must stay and fight.,MALE
THOR,"I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side. ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!,MALE
FANDRAL,"Or one of us, trying to protect you. ",MALE
SIF,The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us.,FEMALE
THOR,You're right.,MALE
THOR,Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day.,MALE
LOKI,Father. Welcome to Asgard.,MALE
SIF,Keep him distracted.,FEMALE
FANDRAL,"What do you think? ""The Svartalfheim Twist?"" ""Kiss of the Hag?"" ""Face Full of Boot?""",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"""The Flying Mountain."" ",MALE
FANDRAL,"Not ""The Flying Mountain!"" It threw out my back for a year last time! ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Trust me, it'll work.",MALE
THOR,"My friends fight bravely, but they won't be able to hold it back much longer.",MALE
FANDRAL,Come on!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,For Asgaaaaard!!!,MALE
JANE,Erik!,FEMALE
SELVIG,Go! Leave me!,FEMALE
THOR,Come on... give me one!,MALE
JANE,What are you doing? What is that?,FEMALE
SELVIG,I'm really starting to like him.,FEMALE
THOR,"Go, while you can! ",MALE
SIF,But the others...,FEMALE
THOR,You can't help them now. Your job is to survive.,MALE
SIF,No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day--,FEMALE
THOR,Live and tell those stories yourself.,MALE
THOR,Get him out of here!,MALE
FANDRAL,No. We can still fight!,MALE
THOR,"But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die!",MALE
THOR,"Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan.",MALE
THOR,"Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents.",MALE
THOR,"Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.",MALE
SELVIG,"Jane, no!",FEMALE
JANE,Oh. My. God.,FEMALE
PHIL COULSON,Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.,MALE
DARCY,"So, how can you speak our language? ",MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours.",MALE
THOR,Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!,MALE
THOR,He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.,MALE
VOLSTAGG,Then we're trapped here forever.,MALE
FANDRAL,Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives.,MALE
FANDRAL,Are all earth maidens as fair as you?,MALE
DARCY,No.,MALE
THOR,Heimdall!,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose.",MALE
FANDRAL,"Sorry, my love. These things happen.",MALE
THOR,"Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally. If you return the items you have stolen from Jane Foster. ",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Not stolen. Borrowed.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,"You'll get your equipment back. You're going to need it to continue your research... which, after today's events, SHIELD would like to fully sponsor. If that's all right with you.",MALE
THOR,"Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it.",MALE
THOR,Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.,MALE
LAUFEY,"It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey.",MALE
LOKI,And your death came by the son of Odin.,MALE
LOKI,"I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever!",MALE
LOKI,And I will make you proud.,MALE
FRIGGA,Thor!,MALE
LOKI,"Found its way back to you, did it? ",MALE
THOR,No thanks to you.,MALE
FRIGGA,What?,MALE
THOR,Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me?,MALE
LOKI,It must have been enforcing Father's last command.,MALE
THOR,"You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been. ",MALE
LOKI,"It's good to have you back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to destroy Jotunheim.",MALE
THOR,Jotunheim...,MALE
LOKI,"All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon.",MALE
LOKI,You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.,MALE
THOR,Why have you done this?,MALE
LOKI,"To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done. ",MALE
THOR,He won't! You can't kill an entire race!,MALE
LOKI,"What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands. ",MALE
THOR,I've changed.,MALE
LOKI,So have I.,MALE
LOKI,Fight me.,MALE
THOR,Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?,MALE
LOKI,I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!,MALE
THOR,"I will not fight you, brother. ",MALE
LOKI,I am not your brother. I never was.,MALE
THOR,"Loki, this is madness...",MALE
LOKI,Is it?,MALE
LOKI,What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman.,MALE
LOKI,It was.,MALE
SELVIG,Jane?,FEMALE
JANE,Something's wrong.,FEMALE
LOKI,"If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them.",MALE
LOKI,Thor! Help me!,MALE
LOKI,Please...,MALE
LOKI,I was always more clever than you.,MALE
THOR,Yet still not clever enough.,MALE
LOKI,"Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now?",MALE
LOKI,Stop! What are you doing?!,MALE
LOKI,"If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again!",MALE
THOR,Forgive me.,MALE
THOR,No!,MALE
ODIN,It is over.,MALE
JANE,It's gone.,FEMALE
VOLSTAGG,"...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low... ",MALE
FANDRAL,Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--,MALE
VOLSTAGG,"As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security! ",MALE
FANDRAL,"Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?",MALE
HOGUN,Big stomach. Big mouth.,MALE
FANDRAL,"Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink!",MALE
SIF,My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss.,FEMALE
FRIGGA,"Thank you, Sif.",MALE
FRIGGA,How is he?,MALE

ODIN,You've already made me proud.,MALE
THOR,Can you see her?,MALE
HEIMDALL,Yes.,MALE
THOR,How is she?,MALE
DARCY,Here you go.,MALE
JANE,Thanks.,FEMALE
DARCY,He would have come back if he could.,MALE
JANE,I know. But if he can't get here on his own...,FEMALE
JANE,...maybe we can help him find his way back.,FEMALE
