TONY STARK,"Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

MAYA HANSEN,"What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? ""The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet."" See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science.

JARVIS,"It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint ALDRICH KILLIAN's broadcast signal.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised

I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
