ODIN,"So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.",MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
ODIN,"Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace.

LOKI,Perhaps we should wait.,MALE,happy,sad,disgusted,angry,fearful,neutral,surprised
