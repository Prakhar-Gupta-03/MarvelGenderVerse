711,711,PETER PARKER,"Alright, sorry, my bad.  Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry.  Wwahhhh!",MALE
712,712,BUCKY,You couldn't have done that earlier?,MALE
713,713,SAM WILSON,I hate you.,MALE

869,869,SAM WILSON,You're the good cop now?,MALE
870,870,TONY STARK,I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.,MALE
871,871,SAM WILSON,"Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.",MALE
872,872,TONY STARK,"Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.",MALE
873,873,SECRETARY ROSS,What did you do? Get it back up!,MALE
874,874,TONY STARK,"Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.",MALE
875,875,SAM WILSON,That's a first.,MALE
876,876,TONY STARK,Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…,MALE

901,901,TONY STARK,"Uh, one.",MALE
902,902,HELMUT ZEMO,"If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.  Did you really think I wanted more of you?",MALE
903,903,BUCKY,What the hell?,MALE
904,904,HELMUT ZEMO,"I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.",MALE
905,905,TONY STARK,I'm betting I could beat that.,MALE
906,906,HELMUT ZEMO,"Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.",MALE
907,907,STEVE ROGERS,You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?,MALE
908,908,HELMUT ZEMO,"I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.",MALE
909,909,STEVE ROGERS,You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?,MALE
910,910,HELMUT ZEMO,Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.,MALE
911,911,STEVE ROGERS,You lost someone?,MALE
912,912,HELMUT ZEMO,I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.,MALE
913,913,TONY STARK,I know that road. What is this?,MALE
914,914,HOWARD STARK,Help my wife. Please. Help.,MALE

921,921,TONY STARK,"Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?",MALE
922,922,STEVE ROGERS,Yes.,MALE
923,923,STEVE ROGERS,Get out of here!,MALE

925,925,TONY STARK,Move!,MALE
926,926,STEVE ROGERS,It wasn't him!,MALE
927,927,FRIDAY,Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.,MALE

934,934,STEVE ROGERS,This isn't gonna change what happened.,MALE
935,935,TONY STARK,I don't care. He killed my mom.,MALE
936,936,ZEMO'S WIFE,"You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.",FEMALE
937,937,T'CHALA,I almost kill the wrong man.,MALE
938,938,HELMUT ZEMO,Hardly an innocent one.,MALE
939,939,T'CHALA,This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.,MALE
940,940,HELMUT ZEMO,"My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, ""Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm."" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.",MALE
941,941,T'CHALA,Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them.  I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.,MALE
942,942,HELMUT ZEMO,Tell that to the dead.,MALE
943,943,T'CHALA,The living are not done with you yet.,MALE
944,944,FRIDAY,You can't beat him hand to hand.,MALE
945,945,TONY STARK,Analyse his fight pattern.,MALE
946,946,FRIDAY,Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.,MALE
947,947,TONY STARK,Let's kick his ass.,MALE
948,948,STEVE ROGERS,He's my friend.,MALE
949,949,TONY STARK,So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.,MALE
950,950,STEVE ROGERS,I can do this all day.,MALE
951,951,TONY STARK,That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield!,MALE
952,952,EVERETT ROSS,"Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm?  So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?",MALE
953,953,HELMUT ZEMO,Did it?,MALE
954,954,TONY STARK,It's just the first pass.,MALE
955,955,JAMES RHODES,Yeah.,MALE
956,956,TONY STARK,Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?,MALE
957,957,JAMES RHODES,You may wanna think about some AC down in . . .,MALE
958,958,TONY STARK,Let's go. I'll give you a hand.,MALE
959,959,JAMES RHODES,"No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think.",MALE
960,960,TONY STARK,You okay?,MALE
961,961,JAMES RHODES,Oh yeah.,MALE
962,962,STAN LEE,"Are you Tony ""Stank""?",MALE
963,963,JAMES RHODES,"Yes, this is--this is Tony ""Stank"". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. ""Stank"". Please, by the bathroom.",MALE
964,964,STEVE ROGERS,"Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . .",MALE
965,965,FRIDAY,Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.,MALE

968,968,TONY STARK,"Ah, please hold.",MALE
969,969,SECRETARY ROSS,No. Don't . . .,MALE
970,970,STEVE ROGERS,"So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.",MALE
971,971,STEVE ROGERS,You sure about this?,MALE
972,972,BUCKY,"I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody.",MALE
973,973,STEVE ROGERS,Thank you for this.,MALE
974,974,T'CHALA,"Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…",MALE
975,975,STEVE ROGERS,"You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.",MALE
976,976,T'CHALA,Let them try.,MALE
977,977,MAY PARKER,So. Who was it? Who hit you?,FEMALE
978,978,PETER PARKER,"Some guy. So itchy, man. God.",MALE
979,979,MAY PARKER,"What's ""some guy's"" name?",FEMALE

983,983,MAY PARKER,Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.,FEMALE
984,984,PETER PARKER,"Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge.  That's way better. Thank you.",MALE
