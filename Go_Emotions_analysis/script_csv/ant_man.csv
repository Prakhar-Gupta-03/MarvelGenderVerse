DR. HANK PYM,I took a detour.  Through your defense lab.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Tell me that isn’t what I think it is.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.",MALE
MITCHELL CARSON,"You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier…",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I’m a scientist.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?",MALE

DR. HANK PYM,I formally tender my resignation.,MALE

DR. HANK PYM,"As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula.",MALE
MITCHELL CARSON,We shouldn’t let him leave the building.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?",FEMALE
MITCHELL CARSON,Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.",MALE
PEACHY,You like that? You like that? Come get you some then!,FEMALE

DALE,Come on in. Pull up some chair.,MALE
DALE,"Three years in San Quentin, huh?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,You found out.,MALE
DALE,Baskin Robbins always finds out.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Look, I’m sorry, alright, but I… no one would hire me.",MALE
DALE,Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Look, I’m… I’m sorry, I… you know, it was… I don’t do it anymore. I’m just trying…",MALE
DALE,Respect. I couldn’t be happier about it.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Really?,MALE
DALE,"Yeah, yeah.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, thank you, thank you.",MALE
DALE,"You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Well, I’m very happy in this job, and I’m… I really just appreciate the opportunities and…",MALE

DALE,Yeah.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker.",MALE
DALE,"No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.",MALE
LUIS,"Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I was, I got fired.",MALE

KURT,Nice to meet you.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, nice to meet you too.  And who are you?",MALE
DAVE,Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.,MALE
KURT,"Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar.",MALE
DAVE,You mean you’re a pussy?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Yeah.,MALE
LUIS,"They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.",MALE
DAVE,Posts all the bank records online.,MALE
LUIS,And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want?,MALE
LUIS,"Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,No way.,MALE
LUIS,"No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail.,MALE
LUIS,"It’s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It’s a perfect Scott Lang mark.",MALE

PYM TECH GATE GUARD,Dr. Pym?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Yes. I’m still alive.,MALE
PYM TECH SECURITY GUARD,I.D.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Perhaps that will suffice.,MALE
PYM TECH SECURITY GUARD,"I’m very sorry, sir. Please come in.",MALE
PYM TECH EMPLOYEE,Is that Hank Pym?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Good morning, Hank.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"More like, thrilled.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What’s the occasion?",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Oh, you’ll see. Won’t he, Hope?",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We’re ready for you inside.,FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Ouch.  I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. You’re in for a treat.",MALE
CARSON,"Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How’s retirement?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,How’s your face?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,After you.,FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest, this company’s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym.  When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research, I couldn’t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon.  An “Ant-Man”.  That’s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Just a tall tale.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real?  Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it’s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket.  The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage.",MALE
VIDEO VOICE OVER,"We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It’s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.",MALE
FRANK,So it’s a suit.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Don’t be crude, Frank. It’s not a suit, it’s a… it’s a vessel. What’s a matter, you’re not impressed?",MALE
FRANK,"Oh, I’m impressed. I’m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,You seem a bit shocked.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Darren, there’s a reason that I buried these secrets.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"So you finally admit it. We could’ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Don’t do this.,MALE
MITCHELL CARSON,"Dr. Cross.  You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,Deal.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"We have to make our move, Hank.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,How close is he?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,He still can’t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,No.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I have Cross’ complete trust.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,It’s too dangerous.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We don’t have a choice.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Well, that’s not entirely true.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I think I found a guy.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Who?,MALE
CASSIE LANG,Daddy!,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I’m so sorry I’m late, I didn’t know what time your party started.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,It was on the invitation!,FEMALE
PAXTON,He didn’t get an invitation! But he came anyway.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Well, I’m not going to miss my little girl’s birthday party.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,I’m gonna go tell mommy you’re here.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, you don’t…",MALE
PAXTON,"What are you doing here, Lang? You haven’t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"It’s good to see you too, Paxton.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,"Mommy’s so happy you’re here, she choked on her drink.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hey, look what I have for you.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,Can I open it now?,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Of course sweetheart, it’s your birthday.",MALE
HIDEOUS RABBIT,You’re my bestest friend!,MALE
PAXTON,What is that thing?,MALE
CASSIE LANG,He’s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.",MALE
HIDEOUS RABBIT,You’re my bestest friend!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It’s just hard finding a job when you have a record.",MALE
PAXTON,"I’m sure you’ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, wait, it’s my daughter’s birthday!",MALE
PAXTON,It’s my house!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"So what, it’s my kid!",MALE
MAGGIE LANG,"Scott! You can’t just show up here, you know that. Come on.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s her birthday party.,MALE
MAGGIE LANG,"Yeah, I know, but you can’t just show up.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,She’s my daughter.,MALE
PAXTON,You don’t know the first thing about being a father.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fiancé is an ass-hat.",MALE
MAGGIE LANG,He’s not an ass-hat.,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Hey, watch your language. Okay?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, what language. I said hat.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?",MALE
MAGGIE LANG,At least he’s not a crook.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"I’m trying, okay? I’ve changed, and I’m straight, I had a job, and… I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I’ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?",MALE
MAGGIE LANG,"Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You’re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"I’m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.",MALE
FRANK,"Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?",MALE
FRANK,But there are laws.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I’ve transcended the laws of nature.",MALE
FRANK,"Darren, I don’t think you understand…",MALE
DARREN CROSS,Hm. We still haven’t worked out all the bugs.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Goodbye, Frank.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,How’s that?,FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could’ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn’t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It’s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn’t he? But we shouldn’t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"You’re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.",FEMALE
LUIS,"Hey, what’s up, hotshot?",MALE
DAVE,Maybe he didn’t hear you.,MALE
LUIS,How was the party?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Tell me about that tip.,MALE
LUIS,What?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I want to know about that tip.,MALE
LUIS,"Ooh, baby, it’s on!",MALE
DAVE,Hot dog!,MALE
LUIS,It’s so on right now!,MALE
DAVE,Look who grew a pair!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it’s gotta be airtight.",MALE
LUIS,"Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don’t love reds man, you know? But there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s the wrong details. It’s wrong… It has nothing to do with the story. Go!,MALE
LUIS,"So, uh, he tells me that she’s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she’s dating this dude Carlos who’s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she’s cleaning for. Right? That he’s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he’s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: “Yo, man. This guy’s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin’.” Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I’ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: “Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: “Nah, dog. All she said is that it’s, like, super legit, and whatever’s in it has gotta be good!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,What?,MALE
KURT,Old man have safe.,MALE
LUIS,And he’s gone for a week.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Alright. There’s an old man, he’s got a safe, and he’s gone for a week. Let’s just work with that.",MALE
LUIS,Y’know what I’m sayin’?,MALE
KURT,"Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.",MALE
LUIS,All check.,MALE
KURT,Check.,MALE
DAVE,Check.,MALE
LUIS,"If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen.",MALE
LUIS,I love it when he gets cocky.,MALE
DAVE,Damn!  Alarm is dead.,MALE
LUIS,Nice!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Alright, I’m moving through the house.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,There’s a fingerprint lock on the door.,MALE
LUIS,"It’s got a what? Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Not necessarily.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I’m in.,MALE
KURT,No alarms have been triggered. He’s in like the Flynn.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, man.",MALE
LUIS,What is it?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Well they weren’t kidding, this safe is serious.",MALE
LUIS,"How serious we talkin’, Scotty?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"It’s a Carbondale. It’s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.",MALE
LUIS,Wow. Can you crack it?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Well, here’s the thing. It doesn’t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?",MALE
LUIS,"Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.",MALE
DAVE,It killed everybody.,MALE
KURT,But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.,MALE
LUIS,What are you doing?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn’t.",MALE
LUIS,What are you doing now?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Waiting. Waiting.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Nice.,MALE
LUIS,"What is it, cash? Jewels?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Well there’s nothing here.,MALE
LUIS,What’d you say?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s a suit.,MALE
LUIS,What?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s an old motorcycle suit.,MALE
LUIS,"There’s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,No. It’s a bust.,MALE
LUIS,"I’m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I thought we were using mice?,FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"What’s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Darren, maybe we should think…",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can’t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Experiment 34C results: Negative.  Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Why would you lock this up?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,So weird.,MALE
LUIS,"Scott, what’s up man?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I wonder… what is this?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"The world sure seems different from down here, doesn’t it, Scott?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,What? Who… who said that?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Luis! Luis, down here!",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"It’s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Guess you’re tougher than you thought.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, I don’t want to see this.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Luis! Ahh! Son of a… !,MALE
CAB DRIVER,What the hell?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I’ll be in touch.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, no. No, thank you.",MALE
COP ON SPEAKER,Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, I didn’t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.",MALE
PAXTON,"You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It’s gonna break their hearts.",MALE
DETECTIVE,You got a visitor.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Who?,MALE
DETECTIVE,Your lawyer.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,My lawyer?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I told you I’d be in touch, Scott. I’m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, man.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Sit down.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Sir, I’m sorry I stole the suit. I don’t even want to know why you have it.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Maggie was right about you.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,How do you know about… ?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I don’t understand.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"No, I don’t expect you to. But you don’t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,What?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Second chances don’t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.,MALE
MAGGIE LANG,Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?,FEMALE
MAGGIE LANG,Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?,FEMALE
CASSIE LANG,"No, I love this one.",FEMALE
MAGGIE LANG,"Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you.",FEMALE
CASSIE LANG,Mommy?,FEMALE
MAGGIE LANG,Hm?,FEMALE
CASSIE LANG,Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he’s bad.,FEMALE
MAGGIE LANG,"No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Smart choice. You actually listened for once.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Under the door.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Okay. Where to now?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Hang tight.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What? What?!,MALE
PAXTON,Where the hell did he go?,MALE
DETECTIVE,"I have no idea, he just vanished.  Set up a five block perimeter, now!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Get back, get back, get back!",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Scott, these are my associates.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where’s the car?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"No car, we’ve got wings. Incoming!",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Are you ki… ? How safe’s this… ?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Get on the damn ant, Scott!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Why am I on a police car? Shouldn’t I not be on a police car?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Whoa. Alright. Now, what’s the next move?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Hang on tight.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, this is easy. I’m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It’s like a horse.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,You’re throwing 2-47 off balance.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Wait, his name is 2-47?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"He doesn’t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Whoa!,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Maybe it’s 2-48.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"No, I think it’s 2-47.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Wait.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Hang on.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I think I’m getting the hang of this.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I’m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What? Can I make one little request?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,No.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"It’s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Just set her down, alright? I’m getting light headed.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Hang on, Scott.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, I’m getting a little light… it’s funny… hit me, and…",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Yes.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Why?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Because the last time you were here you stole something.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh. Oh! Hey, look.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Whoa!,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t. Dr. Pym’s waiting for you downstairs.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Who?  Hey, um, whose pajamas are these?  How am I supposed to do this?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Right, just one step at a time.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Ugh. You don’t bite me, I don’t step on you, deal?",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it. We don’t need this guy.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I did. She’s great.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,She doesn’t think that we need you.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We don’t. We can do this ourselves.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Okay, we can try this and when he fails I’ll do it myself.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"She’s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you’re sitting opposite me, I take it that you’re interested in.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,What job?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Would you like some tea?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, sure.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Were you watching me?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Scott, I’ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp.  Vista’s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It’s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Yeah, thanks.  You know what, I’m okay.  How do you make them do that?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Right. But how do you make them do that?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,And still know absolutely nothing. I’m late to meet Cross.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Uh… Dr. Pym?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You don’t need to raise your hand, Scott.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell’s going on and can I go back to jail now?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Come with me.  Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Huh?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that’s what powers the suit, that’s why it works.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Whoa.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Pym Tech.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Darren Cross. He’s a big deal.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,How could he do that?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"The board’s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain’s chemistry. I don’t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he’s not the most stable guy to begin with.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"So, what do you want from me?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I do.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.,MALE
MAGGIE LANG,You going to be home for dinner tonight?,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Uh, yeah. I’ll pick something up, text you.",MALE
MAGGIE LANG,Okay. Good news?,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Uh, I don’t know. It’s news.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,Are you trying to find my daddy?,FEMALE
PAXTON,"Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.",MALE
CASSIE LANG,Hope you don’t catch him.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That’s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Okay, then why don’t you just send the ants?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hank, I’m a thief. Alright? I’m a good thief. But this is insane.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"He’s right Hank and you know it. You’ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I’m wearing the suit.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Absolutely not!,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We don’t have time to screw around.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Hope, please. Listen to me, please…",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,He is a criminal. I’m your daughter.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,No!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"She’s right, Hank. I’m not your guy. Why don’t you wear the suit?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You think I don’t want to? I can’t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You’re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment. It’s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter’s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It’s not about saving our world, it’s about saving theirs.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Damn, that was a good speech.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs.  Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Ow!  Ah! Ow.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Useless.,FEMALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you’re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it’s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Show me.  Terrible.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,You want to show me how to punch?  Show me…,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,That’s how you punch.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,She’s been looking forward to this.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,No kiddin’.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,We lost her in a plane crash.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We’re working here.  Alright princess, let’s get back to work.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Were you going for the hand?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What does that mean?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,It means that you would enter a quantum realm.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What does *that* mean?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Cool. Yeah. I’m… if it ain’t broke.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You’ve learned about the suit, but you’ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they’re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, you’re not so crazy.  Hey! You’re cute.  Oh! Aaah!  That was a lot scarier a second ago.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"There’s a security guard posted around the clock, we’ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Okay. Who’s next?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Paraponera clavata.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index.  Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom?  Whoa!",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Camponotus pennsylvanicus.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Wait a minute, I know this guy. I’m going to call him Ant-thony.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"That’s good. That’s very good, because this time you’re really going to have to learn how to control him.  Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Oh, you okay, d…",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Hank wants you outside for target practice.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Solenopsis mandibularis.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You can do it Scott, come on.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,They’re not listening to me.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We don’t have time for coddling.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Our focus should be on helping Scott!,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Really? Is that where our focus should be?,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Hope!,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I don’t know why I came to you in the first place.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,We can’t do this without her.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Oh, God.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There’s some weird folks in this neighborhood.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he’s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,I’m doing this for her.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks?,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,He was in grief.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that’s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,He doesn’t want to shut you out. He trusts you.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Then why are you here?,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I’m expendable, that’s why I’m here. You must’ve realized that by now. I mean, that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re not. He’d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway…",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"You know, I didn’t know you had a… a daughter when I called the cops on you. What’s her name?",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Cassie.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"It’s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that’s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus.  Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do.  That’s good.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn’t hesitate.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Janet! No!,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,You were trying to bring her back.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,But all I learned was we know nothing.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,It’s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn’t you tell me this sooner?,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn’t mean to lose you too.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I’m sorry.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"This is awesome. It’s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you’re healing. It’s important.  I ruined the moment didn’t I?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Yes, you did, yes.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I’m gonna make some tea.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Nailed it!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"That’s a good boy, Ant-thony.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s freezing! You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it’s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"You’re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don’t drop me this time.  Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Stay calm.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn’t you say this was some old warehouse?  It’s not!  You son of a bitch!",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Scott, get out of there.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Abort! Abort now.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, it’s okay. It doesn’t look like anyone’s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,He’s gonna lose the suit.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,He’s gonna lose his life.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,Alright I’m on the roof of the target building.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Somebody’s home, Scott.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"What’s going on down there, Sam?",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,It’s the Falcon!,MALE
SAM WILSON,I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything. Wait a second.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Abort, Scott! Abort now.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"It’s okay, he can’t see me.",MALE
SAM WILSON,I can see you.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,He can see me.  Hi. I’m Scott.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott?”,FEMALE
SAM WILSON,What are you doing here?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"First off, I’m a big fan.",MALE
SAM WILSON,Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I’m Ant-Man.  Ant-Man?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"What, you haven’t heard of me? No, you wouldn’t have heard of me.",MALE
SAM WILSON,You want to tell me what you want?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.",MALE
SAM WILSON,I know exactly how that is.  Located the breach. Bringing him in.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Sorry about this!,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,What the hell are you doing?,MALE
SAM WILSON,Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry,MALE
SAM WILSON,That’s enough!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Ant-thony, a little help.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I’ve lost visual!,MALE
SAM WILSON,He’s inside my pack.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Sorry. You seem like a really great guy.,MALE
SAM WILSON,It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything!,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,You got it.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Well done.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn’t he?",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Kind of sounded like he did.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I was good, wasn’t I?",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn’t die?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Now let’s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Don’t mind him. You did good.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Darren. How the hell did you get in here?,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"You left the front door open, Hank. It’s official. You’re old.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,The plans! He will kill him.,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,Well to what do I owe this pleasure?,MALE
DARREN CROSS,I have good news.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Really? What’s that?,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone.  You’re welcome. I know this is odd, but I’d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,What did you see in me?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I don’t know what you mean.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I saw myself.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,Then why did you push me away?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Because I saw too much of myself.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"He knows, he’s baiting you! We have to call it off.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,We’re all taking risks.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,What if he saw me here?,FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,He didn’t. There’s no way.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"How do you know that?  Darren, hi.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Hope, where are you right now?",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"I’m at home, why?",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Don’t let him rile you up, he’s just… he’s just a senile old man.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I’m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Great. Good idea.,FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Thank you, Hope. I’m so lucky to have you on my team.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"He’s tripling security, he’s lost his mind, and he’s on to you.",FEMALE
DR. HANK PYM,But he is not on to you.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"The water main. You can’t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that’s how I get in.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.",MALE
LUIS,"Thank you for the coffee ma’am. It’s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?",FEMALE
LUIS,Two smoothie machines.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,Are you sure they can handle this?,FEMALE
LUIS,"Oh we can handle it, we’re professionals.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,You’ll forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence.,MALE
DAVE,"Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn’t we?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,I let you.,MALE
DAVE,"Well, one could say that I let you let me.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Look, it’s okay. They can handle this.",MALE
LUIS,"Yeah, we can handle it.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,You got their credentials?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,He’s in the system.,FEMALE
LUIS,I’m in the system?,MALE
DAVE,The system.,MALE
LUIS,The system?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Yeah. We’re doomed.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Alright, there’s something you guys need to see.",MALE
LUIS,"Damn! Whoa! That’s so cool, bro!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe. There’s no reason to be scared.",MALE
LUIS,"Aw, no, no. Daddy don’t get scared.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Really?,MALE
LUIS,Yeah.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Good.,MALE
LUIS,Oh!,MALE
KURT,This is the work of the gypsies.,MALE
DAVE,That’s… that’s… that’s witchcraft.,MALE
LUIS,"Oh, that’s amazing. That’s like some David Copperfield shit.",MALE
DAVE,That’s some kind of wizardry.,MALE
KURT,Sorcery!,MALE
LUIS,Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!  Get off! Get off! Ahh!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,I thought daddy didn’t get scared?,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.,FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hey, look. I want to thank you for…",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"No, please don’t. We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.",MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,You really should write poetry.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Get some sleep, Scott.",FEMALE
SCOTT LANG,"Alright, just so we’re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?",MALE
DAVE,Wheels on the ground.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Kurt?,MALE
KURT,Eyes in the sky.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Luis?,MALE
LUIS,"Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that’s what’s up.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Luis.,MALE
LUIS,"I’m sorry, I mean, I’m good, I’m good. I’m just excited, and plus you’re girlfriend’s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too.  And you are very beautiful, ma’am.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Oh, my lord.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,She’s not my…,MALE
LUIS,"Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I’m saying? To like, blend in.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"No, don’t whistle. No whistling. It’s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.",MALE
KURT,We’re set.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Wish me luck.,MALE
KURT,Utility is online.,MALE
ALPHA GUARD,Hey. What are you doing?,MALE
LUIS,"Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I’m securing.",MALE
ALPHA GUARD,I’m the boss.,MALE
LUIS,Oh.,MALE
ALPHA GUARD,Utilities work room three…,MALE
KURT,Water level is dropping.,MALE
KURT,Coming up on extraction pipe.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"I see it!  Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That’s it, that’s it, guys, yeah!  That’s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on!  Alright, let’s fly Ant-thony.",MALE
KURT,The Ant-Man is in the building.,MALE
DAVE,Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.,MALE
KURT,This is problem?,MALE
DAVE,"Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem.",MALE
PAXTON,That’s Pym.,MALE
KURT,"Oh, no.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,I’m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don’t remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy.,MALE
LUIS,"See, that’s what I’m talkin’ bout. That’s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know?",MALE
KURT,"Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.",MALE
DAVE,Looks like Pym’s getting arrested.,MALE
KURT,"Scott, we have problem.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,Problem? What’s the problem?,MALE
KURT,"Dave! Dave, that’s not part of plan!",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Listen to me, if I don’t get into this building people will die.",MALE
GALE,That’s awfully dramatic.,MALE
PAXTON,Are you kidding me?!,MALE
KURT,Problem solved.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,Well. How do I look?  There he is. Just in time. Come on.,MALE
COMPUTER,Twelve point verification.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Little over the top, don’t you think, Darren?",MALE
COMPUTER,Confirming authorization.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"No, you can never be too safe.",MALE
COMPUTER,Access granted.,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"And you only know the half of it, Hank.",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let’s go.  Proceeding to command position.  I’ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I’m in position. I’m going to signal the ants.",MALE
PAXTON,"No, no, no, no!",MALE
DAVE,Did you see that?,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let’s fry these servers.  Let’s go get ‘em, buddy!",MALE
KURT,Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.,MALE
SCOTT LANG,Headed to the particle chamber.,MALE
MITCHELL CARSON,"Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Wonderful.  They’re not what they were, they’re doing some interesting work. And I’m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it’s gonna blow up in your face.  Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all pathetic and weak.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,Well you figured wrong.,MALE
PAXTON,I know this van.  Anybody home?,MALE
DAVE,Shh.,MALE
KURT,Shh.,MALE
DAVE,Shh!,MALE
KURT,Shh!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Alright, guys, I’m here. Setting the charges.  Great job, guys. I’ll take it from here.  Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position.  Guys, how we lookin’ on that laser grid?",MALE
KURT,Almost!,MALE
DAVE,"No, you’re not.",MALE
KURT,I’m getting close!,MALE
DAVE,"No, you’re not.",MALE
PAXTON,San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you’re in there!,MALE
DAVE,Make it go faster.,MALE
KURT,"Dude, seriously!",MALE
SCOTT LANG,"Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?",MALE
KURT,It’s so close.,MALE
PAXTON,Freeze!,MALE
DAVE,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.",MALE
PAXTON,Get out.,MALE
DAVE,Take it easy!,MALE
KURT,Go! Go now!  Wait!,MALE
SCOTT LANG,What? What do you mean wait?  What? What?,MALE
DARREN CROSS,"Hi, little guy.  I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me?  Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"Darren, don’t do this. If you sell to these men, it’s going to be chaos.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,"I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It’s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I’ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I’m keeping the particle to myself. They don’t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?",MALE
DR. HANK PYM,The most powerful man in the world.,MALE
DARREN CROSS,You proud of me yet?,MALE
DR. HANK PYM,"You can stop this, Darren. It’s not too late.",MALE
DARREN CROSS,It’s been too late for a long time now.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"Darren, what are you doing?",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,He wasn’t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.,MALE
HOPE VAN DYNE,"This is not who you are, it’s the particles altering your brain chemistry.",FEMALE
DARREN CROSS,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re right, I have to be the one to do it.",MALE
MITCHELL CARSON,Here we go.,MALE
