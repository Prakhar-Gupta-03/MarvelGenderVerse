SHIELD LIEUTENANT,How come nobody spotted it before?,MALE
SEARCH TEAM LEADER,It’s really not that surprising. This landscape’s changing all the time. You got any ideas what this thing is exactly?,MALE
SHIELD LIEUTENANT,I don’t know. It’s probably a weather balloon.,MALE
SEARCH TEAM LEADER,I don’t think so. You know we don’t have the equipment for a job like this.,MALE

RED SKULL,"No, of course. But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.",MALE
TOWER KEEPER,What you seek is just a legend.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Then why make such an effort to conceal it?  The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin’s treasure room.  It’s not something one buries. But I think it is close, yes?",MALE
TOWER KEEPER,I cannot help you.,MALE
RED SKULL,No. But maybe you can help your village. You must have some friends out there. Some… some little grandchildren perhaps. I have no need for them to die.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Yggdrasil. Tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom and fate, also.  And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert. You have never seen this, have you?",MALE

JAMES BARNES,"This isn’t a back alley, Steve. It’s war!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know it’s a war. You don’t have to tell me.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,That might not be the right file.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"No, it’s not the exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. But you didn’t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is this a test?,MALE

STEVE ROGERS,I don’t wanna kill anyone. I don’t like bullies. I don’t care where they’re from.,MALE

RED SKULL,"I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,What is that?,MALE
RED SKULL,"I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.",MALE

COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I see you’re breaking in the candidates. That’s good!  Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.,MALE
GILMORE HODGE,"Yes, sir.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men…  And because they’re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers.,MALE
SERGEANT DUFFY,Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.",MALE
SERGEANT DUFFY,"Pick up the pace, ladies! Let’s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move!  Squad, halt! That flag means we’re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!",MALE
SOLDIERS,Come on! Get up there!,MALE
SERGEANT DUFFY,"If that’s all you got, this army’s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody’s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let’s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Thank you, sir.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!",FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You’re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he’ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Up.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,You stick a needle in that kids arm and it’s gonna go right through him.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Come on, girls.",FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Look at that. He’s making me cry.,MALE

COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Do you know how long it took to set up this project?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Yeah, I know.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What’s-His-Name’s committees?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, he obeys orders. He’s a soldier.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,He’s a bully.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You don’t win wars with niceness, doctor.  You win war with guts.  Grenade!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Get away! Get back!,MALE
OFFICER,It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is this is a test?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,He’s still skinny.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,May I?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Can’t sleep?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I got the jitters, I guess.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Me, too.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Can I ask you a question?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Just one?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why me?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"I suppose that is the only question that matters.  This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the…  And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, ""You."" He says, ""You will make us strong."" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Schmidt must become that superior man.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did it make him stronger?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thanks. I think.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,To the little guys.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,All right. We’ll drink it after.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,No! I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!,MALE
RED SKULL,Is there something in particular you need?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I understand you found him.,MALE
RED SKULL,See for yourself.  You disapprove.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he will succeed.  Again.,MALE
RED SKULL,"His serum is the Allies’ only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Shall I give the order?,MALE
RED SKULL,It has been given.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Good.,MALE
RED SKULL,Dr. Zola.  What do you think?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,A masterpiece.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Did you have something against running away?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,I know a little of what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You must have danced?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,For what?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,The right partner.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,This way.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What are we doing here?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Follow me.,FEMALE
ANTIQUE STORE OWNER,Wonderful weather this morning isn’t it?,FEMALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.",FEMALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Good morning.  Please, not now.  Are you ready?  Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given me the generators I requisitioned…",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel.  Oh, this is…",MALE
HEINZ KRUGER,"Fred Clemson, State Department.  If this project of yours comes through, we’d like to see it used for something other than headlines.",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Comfortable?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?",MALE
HOWARD STARK,Levels at 100%.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Good.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we’ll ever be.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Agent Carter? Don’t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.",FEMALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Good.  Do you hear me? is this on?  Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,That wasn’t so bad.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"That was penicillin.  Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one.  Now, Mr. Stark.   Steven, can you hear me?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,We will proceed.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,That’s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That’s 40 %.,MALE
SSR DOCTOR,Vital signs are normal.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,That’s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Steven!,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Shut it down.,FEMALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Steven!,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Shut it down!,FEMALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,No! Don’t! I can do this!,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Eighty. Ninety. That’s 100 %.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Mr. Stark?,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Steven. Steven.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,The son of a bitch did it.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I did it.,MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.",MALE
HOWARD STARK,We actually did it.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,How do you feel?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Taller.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You look taller.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,"Thank you, sir.",MALE
DR. ABRAHAM ERSKINE,Stop him!,MALE
TAXI DRIVER,"What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy’s been shot!",MALE

MOTHER,Let go of my son! Don’t hurt him!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Wait, don’t! Don’t!  No! Don’t!",MALE
YOUNG BOY,Go get him! I can swim!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who the hell are you?,MALE
HEINZ KRUGER,"The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA!",MALE
HUTTER,"The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.",MALE
SCHNEIDER,You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.,MALE
RED SKULL,Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.,MALE
ROEDER,You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.,MALE
SCHNEIDER,"The Führer feels… How does he put it? ""The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!""",MALE
RED SKULL,"Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you.  Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.",MALE
ROEDER,And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?,MALE
RED SKULL,"Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.",MALE
ROEDER,Your enemies?,MALE
RED SKULL,"My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.",MALE
SCHNEIDER,"Thank you, Schmidt.",MALE
RED SKULL,For what?,MALE
SCHNEIDER,For making it clear how obviously mad you are.,MALE
HUTTER,Berlin is on this map!,MALE
RED SKULL,So it is.,MALE
HUTTER,You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the Führer himself!,MALE
ROEDER,Schmidt!!!,MALE
RED SKULL,"My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler’s shadow. Hail HYDRA.",MALE
HYDRA TECHNICIANS,Hail HYDRA!,FEMALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Hail HYDRA!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Think you got enough?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,He deserved more than this.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"If it could only work once, he’d be proud it was you.",FEMALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?  What have we got here?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Speaking modestly, I’m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don’t know what’s inside this thing or how it works. We’re not even close to this technology.",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,Then who is?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,HYDRA. I’m sure you’ve been reading our briefings.,MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"I’m on a number of committees, Colonel.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"HYDRA’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he’s invincible.",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,So what are you gonna do about it?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Colonel?,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You’re flying to London tonight.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,You’re an experiment. You’re going to Alamogordo.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,The serum worked.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.,MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I’ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country’s seen it.  Paper. The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Sir, that’s all I want.",MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I don’t know if I can do this.,MALE
BRANDT'S AIDE,"Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi’s. Bing bang boom. You’re an American hero.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It’s just not how I pictured getting there.,MALE
BRANDT'S AIDE,"The senator’s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you’ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield.",MALE
USO SINGER,"Who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there’s still a way all of us can fight.,MALE
USO SINGER,"Who vows to fight like a man, for what’s right, night and day?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,MALE
USO SINGER,"Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.",MALE
DIRECTOR,"Cut. Guys, don’t look ath the camera.",MALE
USO SINGER,We can’t ignore there’s a threat and a war we must win.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.,MALE
USO SINGER,"Who’ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who’ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who’s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love.",MALE
KIDS IN USO AUDIENCE,Turn around! He’s right behind you!,NEUTRAL
STEVE ROGERS,"Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us.",MALE
USO SINGER,"Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who’ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who’s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we’re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it’s no one but Captain America. Who’ll finish what they began? Who’ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?  Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.,MALE
ARMY HECKLER#1,I already volunteered! How do you think I got here?  Bring back the girls!,FEMALE

BRANDT'S AIDE,"Don’t worry, pal. They’ll warm up to you. Don’t worry.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Hello, Steve.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Hi.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Hi.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What are you doin’ here?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Officially I’m not here at all. That was quite a performance.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"I understand you’re ""America’s New Hope""?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Is that Senator Brandt I hear?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know?  What?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights.  They look like they’ve been through hell.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,The one-oh-seventh?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,What?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come on!  Colonel Phillips.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I need the casualty list from Azzano.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You don’t get to give me orders, son.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I can spell.  I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Yeah! It’s called winning the war.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"But if you know where they are, why not at least…?",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. But I don’t expect you to understand that, because you’re a chorus girl.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I think I understand just fine.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir. I do.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,If that’s what it takes.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You don’t know that.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Even so, he’s devising a strategy. If he detects…",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"By the time he’s done that, it could be too late!  You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Every word.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then you gotta let me go.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,I can do more than that.,FEMALE
BRANDT'S AIDE,"On stage, girls. Five minutes!",MALE
USO GIRL,Where’s my helmet?,FEMALE
BRANDT'S AIDE,Has anyone seen Rogers?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.",FEMALE
HOWARD STARK,We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Just get me as close as you can.  You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,And you won’t?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,They will undoubtedly shoot back.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’.",MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen. He’s mad enough to brave this airspace, we’re lucky to have him.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,This is your transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Are you sure this thing works?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"It’s been tested more than you, pal.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You can’t give me orders!,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain!,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.",MALE
RED SKULL,Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"But the prisoners, I’m not sure they have the strength.",MALE
RED SKULL,"Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Not now!,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,"You know, Fritz, one of these days, I’m gonna have a stick of my own.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Fellas.,MALE
HYDRA GUARDS,Ah!,MALE
GABE JONES,Who are you supposed to be?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m… Captain America.,MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,I beg your pardon?,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,"What, are we taking everybody?",MALE
JIM MORITA,"I’m from Fresno, Ace.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.,MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"There’s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one’s ever come back from it.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give ‘em hell. I’ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.",MALE
GABE JONES,Wait! You know what you’re doin’?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.,MALE
JIM MORITA,You know how to use that thing?  Okay.,MALE
RED SKULL,What is happening?,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,Hey. Not exactly a Buick.,MALE
GABE JONES,That one. Zündung.,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,Zündung?,MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Get this thing going, Dugan!",MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,I didn’t know you spoke German.,MALE
GABE JONES,"Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.",MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,Didn’t ask for the resume.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"No, no! What are you doing?",MALE
RED SKULL,Our forces are outmatched.,MALE
JIM MORITA,Keep moving! Grab those grenades!,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Sergeant. 32557…,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Bucky? Oh, my God.",MALE
JAMES BARNES,Is that…,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It’s me. It’s Steve.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Steve?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come on.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Steve.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I thought you were dead.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,I thought you were smaller.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come on.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,What happened to you?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I joined the Army.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Did it hurt?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,A little.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Is it permanent?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,So far.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Captain America! How exciting! I’m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You’ve got no idea.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Haven’t I?  No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success!",MALE
JAMES BARNES,"You don’t have one of those, do you?",MALE
RED SKULL,"You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Then how come you’re running?  Come on, let’s go. Up.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Sir? Are we going to the roof?  What about me? Where will I sit?,MALE
RED SKULL,"Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Let’s go. One at a time.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Gotta be a rope or something!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Just go! Get out of here!,MALE
JAMES BARNES,No! Not without you!,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.",MALE
CORPORAL,"Yes, sir.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I can’t touch Stark. He’s rich and he’s the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I don’t think Captain Rogers did either.",FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,It wasn’t that. I had faith.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Well, I hope that’s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down.  What the hell’s going on out there?",MALE
MAN#1,Look who it is!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Some of theres men need medical attention.,MALE
MAN#2,"Medic, we got wounded.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,That won’t be necessary.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Faith, huh?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You’re late.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Couldn’t call my ride.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Hey! Let’s hear it for Captain America.,MALE
SENATOR BRANDT,"I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America!  Captain America!  Captain, that’s your cue!",MALE
GENERAL,I thought he’d be taller.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic.  And the sixth one was… about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.  I just got a quick look.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Well, nobody’s perfect.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,What about us?,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,We’re already putting together the best men.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"With all due respect, sir. So am I.",MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,"So, let’s get this straight.",MALE
GABE JONES,"We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Pretty much.,MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Sounds rather fun, actually.",MALE
JIM MORITA,I’m in.,MALE
GABE JONES,We’re in.,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,"Hell, I’ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What’s that?,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,Open a tab.,MALE
JIM MORITA,"Well, that was easy.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Another round.,MALE
BARKEEPER,Where are they putting all this stuff?,FEMALE
JAMES BARNES,See? I told you. They’re all idiots.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?,MALE
JAMES BARNES,"Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him. But you’re keeping the outfit, right?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Captain.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Agent Carter.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Ma’am.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Sounds good.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,I see you top squad is prepping for duty.,FEMALE
JAMES BARNES,You don’t like music?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.",FEMALE
JAMES BARNES,Then what are we waiting for?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.",MALE
JAMES BARNES,I’m invisible. I’m…I’m turning into you. It’s like some horrible dream.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about.  Write that down.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.,MALE
PVT. LORRAINE,He’s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you’re welcome to wait.  I read about what you did.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.",MALE
PVT. LORRAINE,Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Really, it’s not a big deal.",MALE
PVT. LORRAINE,Tell that to their wives.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Uh…I don’t think they were all married.,MALE
PVT. LORRAINE,You’re a hero.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really.",MALE
PVT. LORRAINE,"The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh…seeing as they’re not here.",FEMALE
PEGGY CARTER,Captain!  We’re ready for you. If you’re not otherwise occupied.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Agent Carter, wait.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You still don’t know a bloody thing about women!,FEMALE
HOWARD STARK,"Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Really? I didn’t think…,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what’s goin’ on in a woman’s head, it’s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer.  Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra’s not going to attack you with a pocket knife.  I hear you’re uh… kinda attached?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,It’s handier than you might think.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,I took the liberty of coming up with some options.  This one’s fun. She’s been fitted with electrical relays. It’ll allow you to…,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What about this one?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,No! No! That’s just a prototype.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,What’s it made of?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It’s completely vibration absorbent.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,How come it’s not a standard issue?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,That’s the rarest metal on earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,What do you think?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Yes. I think it works.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I had some ideas about the uniform.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Whatever you want, pal.",MALE
RED SKULL,"You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,This is hardly my area of expertise. I…I merely develop the weapons. I…I cannot fire them.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.",MALE
GUARD,Sir!,MALE
FACILITY MANAGER,"I’m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.",FEMALE
RED SKULL,Evidently not.,MALE
JAMES BARNES,Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Yeah, I and I threw up?",MALE
JAMES BARNES,"This isn’t payback, is it?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Now why would I do that?,MALE
GABE JONES,"We were right. Dr. Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.",MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,"Let’s get going, because they’re moving like the devil.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.",MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,Mind the gap.,MALE
DUM DUM DUGAN,"Better get moving, bugs!",MALE
JACQUES DERNEIR,Maintenant!,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Stop him! Fire again!,MALE
JAMES BARNES,I had him on the ropes.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,I know you did.  Get down!,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Fire again! Kill him! Now!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Sit down.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,What is this?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Steak.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,What is in it?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,I don’t eat meat.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Why not?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,It disagrees with me.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we’ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here’s my brilliant theory.  You wanna live.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"You’re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I bought you dinner.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,"‘Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.’",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven’t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Schmidt will know this is a lie.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"He’s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You’re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers’ closest friend. So, I wouldn’t count on the very best of protection. There’s you or Schmidt. It’s just the hand you’ve been dealt.",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Mmm.,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Only the world itself will satisfy him.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"You do realize that’s nuts, don’t you?",MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,And why is that?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,Because he can do it!,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,What’s his target?,MALE
DR. ARNIM ZOLA,His target… is everywhere.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra!",MALE
MAN ON THE RADIO,"Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Dr. Erskine said that… the serum wouldn’t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um…I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects.  It wasn’t your fault.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Did you read the reports?,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Yes.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Then you know that’s not true.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him?  Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m goin’ after Schmidt. I’m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,You won’t be alone.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he’s a God. He’s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.",MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.",MALE
GABE JONES,How much time we got?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,"According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.",MALE
JACQUES DERNEIR,Where is he now?,MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Hydra’s last base is here.  In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.,MALE
JIM MORITA,"So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it’s not like we can just knock on the front door.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Why not? That’s exactly what we’re gonna do.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,He told me you were insane.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Nothin’. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.  I can do this all day.,MALE
RED SKULL,"Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,So am I!,MALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,Rogers! You might need this!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Thanks!,MALE
JIM MORITA,"We’re in! Assault team, go!",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Move out!  Keep your spacing!,MALE
HYDRA SOLDIER,"Cutt off one head, two more shall…",MALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,Let’s go find two more!,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,You’re late.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Weren’t you about to…,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Right.  Keep it steady!,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Wait!  Go get him.,FEMALE
COL. CHESTER PHILLIPS,I’m not kissin’ you!,MALE
RED SKULL,"You don’t give up, do you?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Nope!,MALE
RED SKULL,"You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Not my future!,MALE
RED SKULL,What have you done? No.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?,MALE
JIM MORITA,"Captain Rogers, what is your…",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Steve, is that you? Are you alright?",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,Peggy! Schmidt’s dead.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,What about the plane?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,That’s a little bit tougher to explain.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Give me your coordinates, I’ll find you a safe landing site.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,There’s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"I’ll get Howard on the line, he’ll know what to do.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,There’s not enough time. This thing’s moving too fast and it’s heading for New York.  I gotta put her in the water.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice.  Peggy?",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,I’m here.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,I’m gonna need a rain check on that dance.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,"Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.",FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,You got it.,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Eight o’clock on the dot. Don’t you dare be late. Understood?,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You know, I still don’t know how to dance.",MALE
PEGGY CARTER,I’ll show you how. Just be there.,FEMALE
STEVE ROGERS,We’ll have the band play somethin’ slow. I’d hate to step on your…,MALE
PEGGY CARTER,Steve? Steve? Steve?,FEMALE
JAMES MONTGOMERY FALSWORTH,To the Captain.,MALE
STARK'S ENGINEER,Sir?,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Take us to the next grid point.,MALE
STARK'S ENGINEER,But there’s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.,MALE
HOWARD STARK,Just keep looking.,MALE
DODGERS ANNOUNCER,"Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow’s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn’t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here’s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher’s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won’t get him.",MALE
SHIELD AGENT,"Good morning.  Or should I say, afternoon?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where am I?,MALE
SHIELD AGENT,You’re in a recovery room in New York city.,MALE
DODGERS ANNOUNCER,"The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Where am I really?,MALE
SHIELD AGENT,I’m afraid I don’t understand.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there.  Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?",MALE
SHIELD AGENT,Captain Rogers…,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Who are you?,MALE
SHIELD AGENT,"Captain Rogers, wait!  All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!",MALE
NICK FURY,"At ease, soldier! Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but… we thought it best to break it to you slowly.",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Break what?,MALE
NICK FURY,"You’ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years.  You gonna be okay?",MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Yeah. Yeah. I just…I had a date.,MALE
NICK FURY,Trouble sleeping?,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,"You’re here with a mission, sir?",MALE
NICK FURY,I am.,MALE
STEVE ROGERS,Trying to get me back in the world?,MALE
NICK FURY,Trying to save it.,MALE
