TONY STARK,Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.",MALE
ANTON VANKO,Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,Don’t listen to that crap,MALE
ANTON VANKO,I’m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.,MALE
MAN,270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone,MALE
PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THE CROWD,Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!,NEUTRAL
TONY STARK,It’s good to be back. You missed me?,MALE
MAN IN CROWD,Blow something up!,MALE
TONY STARK,"I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.",MALE
WOMAN IN CROWD,I love you Tony!,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Please, it’s not about me.  It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.  And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.",MALE
HOWARD STARK,"Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,  and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.",MALE
REPORTER,"We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,Make sure you join me…,MALE
TONY STARK,"All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"Open up, let’s go.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.",MALE
PEOPLE,"TONY STARK, Tony",NEUTRAL
TONY STARK,"Hey, hey.",MALE
WOMAN,Call me.,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.",MALE
TONY STARK,Hello. It would be a pleasure.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,Okay,MALE
TONY STARK,See you buddy,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,This is Larry.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.",MALE
LARRY,Call me. Call me.,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,Larry King.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"Come on, Tony. There we go.",MALE
TONY STARK,Very mellow.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,That wasn’t so bad.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, it was perfect.",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"Look what we got here, the new model.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, does she come with the car?",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,I certainly hope so. Hi.,MALE
TONY STARK,Hi. And you are?,MALE
WOMAN,Marshal.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Irish. I like it.,MALE
MARSHAL,Pleased to meet you Tony.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?,MALE
MARSHAL,Bedford.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,What are you doing here?,MALE
MARSHAL,Looking for you.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?,MALE
MARSHAL,Serving subpoenas.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yikes.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,He doesn’t like to be handed things.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I have a peeve.",MALE
MARSHAL,I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Can I see a badge?,MALE
MARSHAL,You wanna see the badge?,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,He likes the badge.,MALE
MARSHAL,You still like it?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yep.  How far are we from D.C.?,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,D.C.? 250 miles.,MALE
STERN,"Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.",MALE
TONY STARK,Yes dear?,MALE
STERN,Can I have your attention?,MALE
TONY STARK,Absolutely.,MALE
STERN,Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?,MALE
TONY STARK,I do not.,MALE
STERN,You do not?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.",MALE
STERN,The Iron Man weapon.,MALE
TONY STARK,My device does not fit that description.,MALE
STERN,Well… How would you describe it?,MALE
TONY STARK,"I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.",MALE
STERN,As?,MALE
TONY STARK,It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.,MALE
STERN,"It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…",MALE
STERN,My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.",MALE
STERN,"Look, I’m no expert…",MALE
TONY STARK,In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.,MALE
STERN,"I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.",MALE
STERN,That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.,MALE
TONY STARK,Rhodey? What?,MALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.",MALE
TONY STARK,I just…,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Drop it.,MALE
TONY STARK,"All right, I’ll drop it.",MALE
STERN,"I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?",MALE
STERN,"Yes, sir.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.,MALE
STERN,I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…,MALE
STERN,"Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…",MALE
STERN,That’s enough Colonel,MALE
JAMES RHODES,…to fold Mr Stark…,MALE
STERN,That’s enough,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"…into the existing chain of command, Senator.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.",MALE
TONY STARK,We can amend the hours a little bit.,MALE
STERN,"I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.,MALE
STERN,"With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"… indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.",MALE
STERN,What is he doing?,MALE
TONY STARK,"If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea.",MALE
STERN,Can you turn that off? Take it off.,MALE
TONY STARK,Iran.,MALE
TONY STARK,No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?,MALE
TONY STARK,"JUSTIN HAMMER, you’re on TV. Focus up.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.,MALE
STERN,I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…,MALE
TONY STARK,"The point is, you’re welcome, I guess",MALE
STERN,For what?,MALE
TONY STARK,Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.,MALE
TONY STARK,I’ve successfully privatised world peace.,MALE
TONY STARK,What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.,MALE
STERN,"you, Mr Stark.  you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.",MALE
TONY STARK,Okay.,MALE
STERN,You’ve been a delight.,MALE
TONY STARK,My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Wake up, Daddy’s home.",MALE
JARVIS,"Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,You!,MALE
TONY STARK,I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.,MALE
TONY STARK,How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?,MALE
JARVIS,"We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,Check palladium levels.,MALE
JARVIS,"Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.",MALE
TONY STARK,"God, they’re running out quick.",MALE
JARVIS,"I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.",MALE
JARVIS,"You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.",MALE
JARVIS,Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…,MALE
TONY STARK,Mute.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Is this a joke? What are you thinking?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,What?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What are you thinking?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Did you just donate…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Keep your business.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,…our entire modern art collection to the…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Boy Scouts of America.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,…Boy Scouts of America?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,It was a tax write-off. I needed that.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,That’s rude.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,The Expo is your ego gone crazy.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You’ve got to be kidding.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,No. Our stocks have never been higher.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, from a managerial standpoint.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Let me give you an example.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Let’s move onto another subject.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.,MALE
TONY STARK,Let’s see what I can get going on here.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Everything was my idea.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,…and you won’t make a decision.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert.  You do it.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I do what?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You will not give me the information…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m not asking you to try…,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,…in order to…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I am trying to do it.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"PEPPER POTTS, you’re not listening to me!",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, you are not listening to me.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Have you been drinking?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.  Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. . I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you.  Congratulations? Take it, just take it.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don’t know what to think.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Don’t think, drink. There you go.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’m on happy time.  Sorry.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,What the hell was that?,MALE
TONY STARK,It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it",MALE

PEPPER POTTS,I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Can you give her a lesson?,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,No problem.,MALE
TONY STARK,Pepper.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Who is she?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I need a new assistant, boss.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, it’s not.",FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,You ever boxed before?,MALE

TONY STARK,"She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,No one speaks Latin.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,No one speaks Latin,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Well…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I need her. She’s got everything that I need.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent.",MALE

HAPPY HOGAN,I just slipped.,MALE
TONY STARK,You did?,MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,"We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?",FEMALE
PEPPER POTTS,When did this happen?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,What? You made me do it.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I made you do what?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You are so predictable.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,That’s the amazing thing.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Right this way.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You look fantastic.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Why, thank you very much.",FEMALE

TONY STARK,Since he got his contract revoked…,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Actually, it’s on hold.",MALE
TONY STARK,…when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?,MALE
CHRISTINE EVERHART,"Yes, what is it?",FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.",MALE

IVAN VANKO,You… You lose. You lose Stark.,MALE
POLICE OFFICER,"We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.",MALE
TONY STARK,Where are we going?,MALE
POLICE OFFICER,Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.,MALE
TONY STARK,Five minutes.,MALE
POLICE OFFICER,Five minutes.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,"You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?",MALE
IVAN VANKO,My father. Anton Vanko.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, I never heard of him.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,My father is the reason you’re alive.,MALE
TONY STARK,"The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.",MALE
TONY STARK,Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die.",MALE
STERN,"It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”",MALE
TONY STARK,Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What is that?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,This is your in-flight meal.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Did you just make that?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"TONY STARK, what are you not telling me?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, yes.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,It’s a great place to be healthy.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,A leave?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,A company retreat.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,A retreat? During a time like this?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?",MALE
JACK,We have some salmon carpaccio.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Very good, man.",MALE

IVAN VANKO,I want my bird.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?",MALE

NEWS READER,"But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.,FEMALE
JARVIS,"Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, IVAN VANKO, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"TONY STARK, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, TONY STARK, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?",MALE
TONY STARK,Let’s go.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, I should get to my desk.  See that cigar box?",MALE

TONY STARK,It’s palladium.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,Is that supposed to be smoking?,MALE
TONY STARK,"If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?,MALE
TONY STARK,Road rash. Thank you.  What are you looking at?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around.  You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,unintelligible,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Sorry?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,Software shit.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait!  Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,What you want them do?,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?",MALE
IVAN VANKO,I can do that. No problem.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?",FEMALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,Probably.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Ill-timed.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Right, sends the wrong message.",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Inappropriate.  Is that dirty enough for you?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over.  I’ll take that. Why don’t you…  I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Legal.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?",MALE

PEPPER POTTS,"Okay. I’ll take this, you take that",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, PEPPER POTTS, doesn’t like it, there’s the door.  Yeah!  Hit!  Pull!  I think she wants the Gallagher!",MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,"I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I suggest you apologise.,MALE
NICK FURY,"You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…",MALE
TONY STARK,You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.,MALE
NICK FURY,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?  Is that possible?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,What do you want from me?,MALE
NICK FURY,"What do we want from you? What do you want from me?  You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.  Hit him.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?",MALE
NICK FURY,What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.,MALE
TONY STARK,Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.",FEMALE
NICK FURY,Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.,MALE

JUSTIN HAMMER,We got this bird all the way from Russia.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Hey, man, this is not my bird.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that?  Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?",MALE
JACK,No.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.  See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?",MALE
IVAN VANKO,Drone better.,MALE

IVAN VANKO,People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"IVAN VANKO, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.",MALE

JAMES RHODES,Thank you sir.,MALE
NICK FURY,That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.,MALE
TONY STARK,"No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…",MALE
NICK FURY,"No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?",MALE
NICK FURY,"Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.",MALE
TONY STARK,You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?,MALE
NICK FURY,He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.,MALE
TONY STARK,He said that?,MALE
NICK FURY,"Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.",MALE
TONY STARK,"I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.",MALE
NICK FURY,What do you remember about your dad?,MALE
TONY STARK,"He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.",MALE
NICK FURY,That’s not true.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.",MALE
NICK FURY,"As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.",MALE
TONY STARK,What?,MALE
NICK FURY,I got a two o’clock,MALE
TONY STARK,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?",MALE
NICK FURY,"Okay, you’re good, right?",MALE

NATASHA ROMANOFF,We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?",MALE
TONY STARK,"I think I got it, yeah.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Enjoy your evening’s entertainment.,MALE
MAJOR ALLEN,Think this is the power source?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?",MALE
MAJOR ALLEN,"Yes, sir.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…",MALE
JAMES RHODES,That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, you’re talking to the right guy.  Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,I think I’ll take it.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Which one?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,All of it.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,All of it.,MALE

City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… TONY STARK, what are you doing back there? What is that?  Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother?

This is a ridiculous way… Everything  is achievable through technology.  Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you.",MALE

TONY STARK,Mute.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I’ll get this stuff out of here.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo.  Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?",FEMALE

PEPPER POTTS,You didn’t come here to apologise?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,No.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Yes.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I need you…,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I need you too.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,…to leave now,FEMALE
TONY STARK,That’s what I’m trying to…,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Ms Potts?,FEMALE

HAPPY HOGAN,"Anything else, boss?",MALE
TONY STARK,"I’m good, Hap.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, I’ll be just another minute.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"I lost both the kids in the divorce.  Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is NATASHA ROMANOFF, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,No. That’s not so.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.",FEMALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Absolutely.  I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?",MALE
TONY STARK,Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You’re good.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.",MALE
JARVIS,"1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.",MALE
TONY STARK,How many buildings are there?,MALE
JARVIS,Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?,MALE
TONY STARK,That was rhetorical. Just show me.  What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.,MALE
JARVIS,"What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?",MALE
TONY STARK,"I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.  Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad.  Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.",MALE
JARVIS,The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.,MALE
TONY STARK,Thank Dad.,MALE
JARVIS,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,I heard you broke the perimeter.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?",MALE
PHIL COULSON,I was doing some stuff.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?",MALE
PHIL COULSON,What’s this doing here?,MALE
TONY STARK,That’s it. Bring that to me.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,You know what this is?,MALE
TONY STARK,"It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it.  Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.,MALE
TONY STARK,Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,So I’m told.,MALE
TONY STARK,Secret stuff?,MALE
PHIL COULSON,Something like that. Good luck.,MALE
TONY STARK,Bye. Thanks.,MALE
PHIL COULSON,We need you.,MALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, more than you know.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,Not that much.,MALE
JARVIS,Initialising prismatic accelerator.  Approaching maximum power.,MALE
TONY STARK,That was easy.,MALE
JARVIS,"Congratulations sir. You have created a new element.  Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,The drone is not going to be ready.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Not ready? What do you mean?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"I can make presentation, not demonstration.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,What the hell is the difference?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,Presentation. No fly. No shoot.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,I can make salute.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Hey, man, everything will be okay.",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,This is not what I wanted.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.",MALE
IVAN VANKO,Hey!,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?",MALE
IVAN VANKO,unintelligible,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…",MALE
JARVIS,Incoming call with a blocked number sir.,MALE
TONY STARK,My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Hey, TONY STARK, how you doing? I double cycle.",MALE
TONY STARK,You what?,MALE
IVAN VANKO,You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.,MALE
TONY STARK,You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,You too.,MALE
TONY STARK,Trace him.,MALE
JARVIS,Sir.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.",MALE
TONY STARK,"Jarvis, where is he?",MALE
JARVIS,Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,"What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.",MALE
TONY STARK,Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.,MALE
JARVIS,Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.,MALE
IVAN VANKO,I hope you’re ready.,MALE
JARVIS,Call trace incomplete.,MALE
JARVIS,Sir,MALE
TONY STARK,"You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.",MALE
JARVIS,We are unclear as to the effects.,MALE
TONY STARK,"I don’t want to hear it Jarvis.  That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!",MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"I’ll keep the car down here, all right?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Thank you Happy.,FEMALE
ANNOUNCER,…Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Oh, Lord.",FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink.  Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone.  Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war  Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,What?,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for…",MALE
TONY STARK,We got trouble.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"TONY STARK, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.",MALE
TONY STARK,Give them a wave.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Hey, all right. Yeah.",MALE
TONY STARK,All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?",MALE
TONY STARK,"Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Vanko’s alive?,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Yeah.,MALE
TONY STARK,What is he?,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,What?,MALE
TONY STARK,Where’s Vanko?,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Who?,MALE
TONY STARK,Tell me.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,What are you doing here man?,MALE

TONY STARK,On what?,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"On you.  TONY STARK, on your six!",MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,What’s going on? What’s happening?,MALE
TECHNICIAN,The software’s been overridden.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?,MALE
TECHNICIAN,I think he slaved the drones.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,That’s impossible. Call the guards.,MALE
JACK,All the phones are down sir.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Well, then call their… Call their cells.",MALE
JACK,Their cell phones are not working either sir.,MALE
TECHNICIAN,He’s locked us out of the mainframe.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Have you now?,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you  Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?",MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Ivan. Ivan Vanko.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Where is he?,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,At my facility.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I need NYPD, please.",FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"No, no, no!",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Command Central.,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Okay. Right away. Right away.  Step aside. Step aside.  Tell me everything you know. Go.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,How are we doing Jarvis?,MALE
JARVIS,Remote reboot unsuccessful.,MALE
HAMMER SECURITY GUARD,This way.,MALE
HAPPY HOGAN,Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,I’m not taking you anywhere.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,Fine. You want me to drive?,FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,"No, I’m driving. Get in the car.",MALE
TONY STARK,Nice work kid.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,You got multiples coming in on you.,MALE
TONY STARK,Let’s get this away from the Expo.,MALE
NATASHA ROMANOFF,"Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter.  I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.",FEMALE
HAPPY HOGAN,I got it. I got it.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.",MALE

TONY STARK,I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,You didn’t let me.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Why didn’t you tell me that?,FEMALE
TONY STARK,I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.,MALE

JUSTIN HAMMER,I told you that five minutes ago.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,That’s your guy here.,FEMALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Excuse me?,MALE
POLICE OFFICER,You’re being placed under arrest.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,Are you kidding me?,MALE
POLICE OFFICER,Hands behind your back sir.,MALE
JUSTIN HAMMER,"I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me?  I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.",FEMALE

TONY STARK,You can’t?,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I can’t take this.,FEMALE

PEPPER POTTS,"My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I think I did okay.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.,FEMALE

TONY STARK,"Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"Well, with you it’s like dog years.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,I know.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I mean, it’s like the Presidency.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,Weird.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"No, it’s not weird.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"It’s okay, right?",MALE
PEPPER POTTS,Yeah.,FEMALE
TONY STARK,Run that by me again.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,I think it was weird.  You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.,MALE
PEPPER POTTS,"I had just quit, actually.",FEMALE
TONY STARK,"Yeah, so we’re not…",MALE
JAMES RHODES,You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.,MALE
TONY STARK,You should get lost.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,I was here first. Get a roof.,MALE
TONY STARK,I thought you were out of one-liners.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,That’s the last one.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You kicked ass back there, by the way.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,"Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?",MALE
TONY STARK,Not okay. Not okay with that.,MALE
JAMES RHODES,It wasn’t a question.,MALE
TONY STARK,How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?,MALE
NICK FURY,"I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.",MALE
TONY STARK,"“Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.",MALE
NICK FURY,Read on.,MALE
TONY STARK,“Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.,MALE
NICK FURY,Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant.,MALE
TONY STARK,"You can’t afford me.  Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.",MALE
NICK FURY,I’ll see what I can do.,MALE
STERN,"It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure.  Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.",MALE
JAMES RHODES,Thank you sir.,MALE
STERN,"Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.  Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.",MALE
PHIL COULSON,"Sir, we’ve found it.",MALE
